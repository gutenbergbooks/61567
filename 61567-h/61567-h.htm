  <div><i>May it please your</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>,</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TO accept of this attempt to illustrate one of the noblest antiquities
    now left upon earth. I am confident your Grace will not dislike it,
    either because it is a religious antiquity, or because it belongs to
    our own country.</p>

  <p>Your Grace best shews your regard to religion, by a constant attendance
    on its duties, in the service of the church; and by a regular practice
    of its precepts, in their whole extent. And as you are justly sensible,
    the foundation of religion rests on a careful observance of the
    sabbath: you not only study to encourage it, by your own great example;
    but likewise discountenance, that too fashionable custom of travelling
    on Sundays, and other profanations thereof: which are the sure root of
    national corruption, the sure presage of national ruin.</p>

  <p>Nor are your Grace’s virtues more conspicuous, in your religious and
    moral character, than in the love of your country. This you inherit
    with the blood that runs in your veins; this you derive from an
    immemorial series of noble ancestors, renowned in our annals, for
    their steady allegiance to the sovereign power; for their vigor in
    support of the constitution both in church and state; that have often
    hazarded and ruined their fortunes, and poured out their blood, in its
    defence. I might instance particularly, the great part they bore in the
    Reformation, the Restoration and the Revolution.</p>

  <p>After the honour I have enjoyed of having been long known to your
    Grace: I could enlarge upon the amiable qualities of your private
    life, your domestic and social virtues, your humane and beneficent
    disposition to all around you, friends or dependants, or those of your
    own family. With truth I might say, that you never refused to serve any
    person that applied to you, where it was in your power: that you never
    knowingly did an unkind, an injurious thing to any person: that no one
    ever withdrew griev’d from your presence. I can safely affirm, and fear
    no contradiction, that justice, honour and honesty are some of the real
    jewels, that adorn your Grace’s coronet. And they, at this time of day,
    receive a seasonable lustre, from your high station, and illustrious
    birth.</p>

  <p>But the agreableness of the subject insensibly drew me from my main
    purpose, which was to make this publick acknowledgment, of the great
    favours your Grace has confer’d upon me: and to beg leave to profess
    myself,</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">A <i>few years ago I spent some time every summer in viewing, measuring,
    and considering the works of the ancient Druids in our Island; I mean
    those remarkable circles of Stones which we find all over the kingdom,
    many of which I have seen, but of many more I have had accounts. Their
    greatness and number astonish’d me, nor need I be afraid to say, their
    beauty and design, as well as antiquity, drew my particular attention.
    I could not help carrying my inquiries about them as far as I was able.
    My studies this way have produc’d a vast quantity of drawings and
    writing, which consider’d as an intire work, may thus be intitled</i>,</p>

    <div class="small gespertt">OF THE</div>
    <div>Origin and Progress of true Religion, and of Idolatry.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="center mt2"><i>The parts of which the whole is compos’d are these</i>:</div>

  <p>I. Canon Mosaicæ Chronologiæ, <i>or the year of</i> Moses <i>settled, by
    which he reckons time in the history of the old world; the time of
    the year fix’d when creation was begun. This is done in a new manner,
    and becomes an intire system of chronology from the creation to the</i>
    Exodus, <i>and is exemplified by many particular Kalendars of the
    most remarkable transactions; which are proofs of the truth of the
    Canon. There are interspersed a great many astronomical and historical
    illustrations of the sacred pages, particularly</i> Sanchoniathon’<i>s
    genealogies, and</i> Manethon’<i>s</i> Egyptian <i>Dynasties, are applied in a
    new Method to the history and chronology of the Scriptures.</i></p>

  <p>II. Melchisedec, <i>or a delineation of the first and patriarchal
    religion, from the best light we can gather in the sacred history;
    and from the most ancient heathen customs, which were remains of
    that religion. In this Treatise it is shewn, that the first religion
    was no other than Christianity, the Mosaic dispensation, as a veil,
    intervening; that all mankind from the creation had a knowledge of the
    plurality of persons in the Deity.</i></p>

  <p>III. <i>Of the mysteries of the ancients, one of the first deviations
    from true religion, to idolatry; this is chiefly pursu’d in an
    explication of the famous table of</i> Isis, <i>or</i> Bembin-<i>table, publish’d
    by</i> Pignorius, Kircher, &amp;c. <i>wherein that knowledge which the ancients
    had concerning the true nature of the Deity, is further explain’d.</i></p>

  <p>IV. <i>A discourse on the hieroglyphic learning of the ancients, and of
    the origin of the alphabet of letters. Very many hieroglyphic monuments
    of the</i> Egyptians <i>are explain’d, more especially those that relate to
    their true notions of the persons in the Deity. The time and rise of
    the alphabet of letters is deduc’d from a new foundation. The present
    square</i> Hebrew <i>characters are shewn to be the primitive idea of
    letters, from whence all others are deriv’d. Whence the idea of every
    letter was taken? an explication of all the old</i> Hebrew <i>coins with</i>
    Samaritan <i>characters.</i></p>

  <p>V. <i>The patriarchal history, particularly of</i> Abraham, <i>is largely
    pursu’d; and the deduction of the</i> Phœnician <i>colony into the Island
    of</i> Britain, <i>about or soon after his time; whence the origin of
    the</i> Druids, <i>of their Religion and writing; they brought the
    patriarchal Religion along with them, and some knowledge of symbols
    or hieroglyphics, like those of the ancient</i> Egyptians; <i>they had the
    notion and expectation of the Messiah, and of the time of the year when
    he was to be born, of his office and death.</i></p>

  <p>VI. <i>Of the Temples of the Druids in</i> Britain, <i>their religious rites,
    orders, sacrifices, groves, tombs, their</i> cursus’<i>s, places of sports
    and exercises,</i> &amp;c. <i>particularly an ample and accurate description of
    that stupendous temple of theirs at</i> Abury <i>in</i> North Wiltshire, <i>the
    most august work at this day upon the globe of the earth; with many
    prints of ground-plots, views and admeasurements of all its parts; of
    their manner of sepulture; an account of my digging into many of their
    barrows and</i> tumuli, <i>with drawings of them,</i> &amp;c.</p>

  <p>VII. <i>Of the celebrated</i> Stonehenge, <i>another Temple of theirs, with
    prints of that work; an account of the barrows I dug up, and what was
    discover’d in them; of the knowledge the Druids had of the magnetical
    compass, and conjectures of the particular times when these works were
    made, long before</i> Cæsar <i>arriv’d in</i> Britain.</p>

  <p><i>I propose to publish these two first, and proceed to the speculative
    parts afterwards; reserving them, God willing, to the maturer time of
    my life.</i></p>

  <p><i>My intent is (besides preserving the memory of these extraordinary
    monuments, so much to the honour of our country, now in great danger
    of ruin) to promote, as much as I am able, the knowledge and practice
    of ancient and true Religion; to revive in the minds of the learned
    the spirit of Christianity, nearly as old as the Creation, which is
    now languishing among us; to restore the first and great Idea of
    the Deity, who has carry’d on the same regular and golden chain of
    Religion from the beginning to this day; to warm our hearts into
    that true sense of Religion, which keeps the medium between ignorant
    superstition and learned free-thinking, between slovenly fanaticism
    and popish pageantry, between enthusiasm and the rational worship of
    God, which is no where upon earth done, in my judgment, better than in
    the Church of</i> England. <i>And seeing a spirit of Scepticism has of late
    become so fashionable and audacious as to strike at the fundamentals
    of all revelation, I have endeavoured to trace it back to the fountain
    of Divinity, whence it flows; and shew that Religion is one system
    as old as the world, and that is the Christian Religion; that God
    did not leave the rational part of his creation, like the colony of
    an ant-hill, with no other guide than instinct, but proportion’d his
    discoveries to the age of the world, to the learning, wisdom, and
    experience of it; as a wise parent does now to his children. I shall
    shew likewise, that our predecessors, the Druids of</i> Britain, <i>tho’
    left in the extremest west to the improvement of their own thoughts,
    yet advanc’d their inquiries, under all disadvantages, to such
    heights, as should make our moderns asham’d, to wink in the sun-shine
    of learning and religion. And we may with reason conclude, there was
    somewhat very extraordinary in those principles, which prompted them
    to such a noble spirit as produced these works, still visible with
    us, which for grandeur, simplicity and antiquity, exceed any of the</i>
    European <i>wonders.</i></p>

  <p><i>That the doctrines and works of the Druids have hitherto been so
    little considered (since authors only transcribe from one to another,
    the few remaining scraps to be found in classic writers) was an
    incentive to me likewise in the following attempt, and at the same time
    it pleads for me, and bespeaks the reader’s favour. I want likewise the
    great advantages to be had from a knowledge of the remaining</i> Celtic
    <i>languages, books, manuscripts, and history, the</i> Cornish, Welsh,
    Irish, Highland, &amp;c. <i>the chief repository now of their doctrines and
    customs; so that in my own opinion I may very well say with the poet,</i></p>

  <p><i>And tho’ there has been of late a large volume publish’d on the
    subject of</i> Stonehenge, <i>yet we may well say there has nothing
    been wrote upon the subject. Nor have I any other notion of this
    performance, than that it is as a first attempt to say something upon
    those famous philosophers and priests the Druids, who are never spoken
    of in antiquity but with a note of admiration; and are always rank’d
    with the Magi of the</i> Persians, <i>the gymnosophists of the</i> Indians,
    <i>the prophets and hierophants of the</i> Egyptians, <i>and those sort of
    patriarchal priests, whose orders commenc’d before idolatry began; from
    whom the</i> Pythagoreans, Platonists, <i>and</i> Greek <i>philosophers learn’d
    the best things they knew. To clear away rubbish, and lay a foundation
    only, in this difficult and obscure work, is doing somewhat. The method
    of writing which I have chose is a diffusive one, not pretending to a
    formal and stiff scholastic proof of every thing I say, which would be
    odious and irksome to the reader, as well as myself. The knowledge I
    have acquired in these matters, was from examining and studying their
    works; the proofs are deriv’d from distant and different topicks, and
    it would be very inconvenient to marshal them syllogistically in a
    work of this nature; the proof results from the intire work; in all
    matters of so great antiquity it must be found out by the reader; and
    to one that has proper sagacity and judgment, conviction will steal
    upon him insensibly, if I am not mistaken; and he will own the evidence
    in general, is as strong as the nature of the subject will bear, or
    requires.</i></p>

  <p><i>It was very disagreeable to me that I was forc’d to combat against a
    book publish’d in the name of the celebrated</i> Inigo Jones, <i>for whose
    memory I have the greatest regard. I wonder the publisher of that work
    did not think of a very easy method to convince himself that he was in
    an error. If</i> Stonehenge <i>is a</i> Roman <i>work, it was certainly built by
    the</i> Roman <i>scale; had he reduc’d his own measures to that standard, he
    would have seen the absurdity of his opinion; for we cannot think that
    a temple, or elegant building, as he would have it, should not shew its
    founders by the scale on which it is form’d; they are all fractions in
    the</i> Roman <i>scale, undoubted evidence that the</i> Romans <i>had no hand in
    it. For there is no meaning, no design in the choice of the measures,
    neither in general nor particular; a thing unworthy of a great
    architect, or a great design. But it appears very evident to me, that</i>
    Inigo Jones <i>had little or no part in that work, especially as it is
    moulded at present; and I think I have reason to be of opinion that he
    never drew the designs therein published, because I should be unwilling
    to say he knowingly falsified them. I have very much shortened what I
    had to say against that book, because I have no love for wrangling, and
    barely mention’d what was necessary, that the reader may have a true
    notion of this noble antiquity.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Wiltshire</i> downs, or <i>Salisbury</i> plain, (as commonly call’d) for
    extent and beauty, is, without controversy, one of the most delightful
    parts of <i>Britain</i>. But of late years great encroachments have been
    made upon it by the plough, which threatens the ruin of this fine
    champain, and of all the monuments of antiquity thereabouts. Monuments,
    we can scarce say, whether more wonderful in themselves, more observ’d,
    or less understood! among them, <i>Stonehenge</i> has been eminent from the
    remotest ages, tho’ ’tis not the greatest, most considerable, or most
    ancient. But ’tis my intent to begin my discourse from it, because the
    latest, and from thence proceed upwards in our inquiries, about the
    times and authors of these stupendous works, the temples of the Druids
    in our Island: for I cannot doubt that <i>Stonehenge</i> was such. The idea
    we conceive of the distance of time, when these kind of works were
    made, cannot be ill-form’d, if we consider, that the utmost accounts
    of ’em we have in writing, are from the <i>Britons</i>, the remains of the
    people who lived here, at the time of the <i>Roman</i> invasion. This is
    mention’d in some manuscripts of <i>Ninnius</i> before the <i>Saxons</i> and
    <i>Danes</i> came over. And the oldest <i>Britons</i> speak of this only by
    tradition, far above all memorial. They wonder’d at <i>Stonehenge</i> then,
    and were as far to seek about the founders and intent of it, as we
    now. They have recourse to magic, as is usual, when they would account
    for any thing seemingly so much above human power, to accomplish.
    They tell us, these stones of immense bulk were brought from a plain,
    in the middle of <i>Ireland</i>, and the like. Which reports give us only
    no obscure hint of their true authors, the Druids, who were fam’d
    for magic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> and were driven last into <i>Ireland</i>, in the time of the
    <i>Romans</i>. There they built such like works again, or their brethren
    had built before; till Christianity, to which the greatest and purest
    part of their own doctrine was akin, soon put an end to their polity,
    which the <i>Roman</i> arms could not do. And they embrac’d that religion,
    to which their own opinions and rites had so direct a tendency. This
    is the sentiment of <i>Origen</i> on <i>Ezekiel</i> iv. And ’tis sufficiently
    evident, if we consider, that the first planters of Christianity in
    <i>Ireland</i>, immediately converted the whole island, without so much
    as the blood of one martyr. Nay, the Druids themselves, at that time
    the only national priests, embraced it readily, and some of them were
    very zealous preachers of it, and effectual converters of others. For
    instance, the great <i>Columbanus</i> himself was a Druid: the apostle of
    <i>Ireland</i>, <i>Cornwall</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> We need not be surpriz’d at this, when
    we assert, that there is very much reason to believe, these famous
    philosophic priests came hither, as a <i>Phœnician</i> colony, in the very
    earliest times, even as soon as <i>Tyre</i> was founded: during the life of
    the patriarch <i>Abraham</i>, or very soon after. Therefore they brought
    along with them the patriarchal religion, which was so extremely like
    Christianity, that in effect it differ’d from it only in this; they
    believed in a Messiah who was to come into the world, as we believe
    in him that is come. Further, they came from that very country where
    <i>Abraham</i> liv’d, his sons and grandsons; a family God almighty had
    separated from the gross of mankind, to stifle the seeds of idolatry; a
    mighty prince, and preacher of righteousness. And tho’ the memoirs of
    our Druids are extremely short, yet we can very evidently discover from
    them, that the Druids were of <i>Abraham</i>’s religion intirely, at least
    in the earliest times, and worshipp’d the supreme Being in the same
    manner as he did, and probably according to his example, or the example
    of his and their common ancestors.</p>

  <p>All this I shall prove, in the pursuit of this work. But before we come
    to speculation, intend to give an exact description of their several
    temples, and the like works; for such will be a good foundation for us
    to build upon. That we may proceed from things evident and more known,
    to those less known, and which we design to make evident, as well as we
    are able, and the nature of it will permit. A matter so immers’d in the
    dark mist of time, where very few scatter’d traces remain, must needs
    bespeak the reader’s candor. The dignity of the subject will excuse
    my boldness in attempting one so difficult. And however I succeed in
    accounting for these wonderful works; at least, I shall be instrumental
    in preserving their memory, in giving just drawings of them.</p>

  <p><i>Stonehenge</i>, by the extravagant grandeur of the work, has attracted
    the eyes and admiration of all ages. After the reformation, upon the
    revival of learning among us, the curious began to consider it more
    intimately, I cannot say successfully. Mr. <i>Camden</i> rose as the sun of
    antiquity, that put out former lights, and, like <i>Cæsar</i>, affrights
    all that value a reputation, from attempting any thing in his way.
    His great skill in <i>Roman</i> learning, and our <i>English</i> history, only
    enabled him to be, as it were, silent on <i>Stonehenge</i>. He saw with
    excellent judgment, that neither <i>Roman</i> nor <i>English</i> had place
    there, or could serve to illustrate it. He writes modestly, as his
    manner was; “Of these things I am not able so much to give an accurate
    account, as mightily to grieve, that the founders of this noble
    monument cannot be trac’d out.” He could not persuade himself that
    either <i>Romans</i>, <i>Saxons</i> or <i>Danes</i> had any hand in it. And as for his
    representation of it in picture, I verily believe, it was drawn only
    from fancy or memory, or by some engraver from his oral description.
    <i>A. D.</i> 1620, king <i>James</i> I. being at the earl of <i>Pembroke</i>’s seat
    at <i>Wilton</i>, and agreeably surpriz’d with the sight of <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    consulted the famous architect <i>Inigo Jones</i>, upon it; thinking it a
    matter in his way. This great man, who deservedly may be stiled the
    <i>English Vitruvius</i>, gave his opinion of it, as a <i>Roman</i> work; and
    left, I suppose, some few indigested notes in writing there-upon.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>From which his son-in-law <i>John Webb</i> compos’d an intire treatise,
    endeavouring to prove it. But they that are acquainted with <i>Roman</i>
    architecture, or have consider’d <i>Stonehenge</i>, must needs be of a
    different opinion. And as my Lord Bishop of <i>London</i> well observes, in
    his notes on <i>Camden</i>, “it cannot be safe to close with Mr. <i>Jones</i>,
    tho’ his book otherwise be a learned and ingenious piece.” <i>Inigo
    Jones</i> lived 30 years after this, and yet Mr. <i>Webb</i> makes an apology
    for his work, “that if he had surviv’d to have done it, with his own
    hand, it would have been better.” But ’tis very reasonably believ’d,
    that tho’ <i>Inigo Jones</i> was an extraordinary genius in architecture,
    yet he wanted many qualifications for an author, especially in such
    a work as <i>Stonehenge</i>. ’Tis my opinion, that had his architectonic
    skill been united to Mr. <i>Camden</i>’s learning, he could never have
    demonstrated <i>Stonehenge</i> to be a <i>Roman</i> work. Afterwards, Dr.
    <i>Charlton</i> publish’d a piece against <i>Webb</i>’s performance, and
    certainly has said enough to overthrow it, tho’ he could not with equal
    success establish his own opinion, that it was the work of the <i>Danes</i>.
    Whereas <i>Olaus Wormius</i> finds no such monuments among the <i>Gothic</i>
    nations: which, as Mr. <i>Toland</i> observes, is answer sufficient to his
    allegation. <i>Webb</i> answer’d the Doctor’s book, and by turns effectually
    demolish’d his opinion, but could not still vindicate his own. Yet
    from all their disputations, no spark was struck, towards a discovery
    of the real truth. What is the worst part in both performances of Mr.
    <i>Webb</i>, his representation of the real monument in his drawings, is
    fictitious. And, as Mr. <i>Aubry</i> rightly observes, “in endeavouring to
    retrieve a piece of architecture in <i>Vitruvius</i>, he abuses the reader
    with a false representation of the whole.” It requires no great pains
    to prove this, nor need we take much time to be satisfy’d in it: the
    work is still extant. As soon as a judicious eye comes upon the spot,
    we discern that <i>Webb</i>’s equilateral triangles forming the cell are
    fancies: his three entrances across the ditch are so too; and that he
    has turn’d the cell a sixth part from its true situation, to favour his
    imaginary hypothesis. But ’tis against my inclination to find fault
    with the labours of others, nor do I thereby seek to bribe the reader
    in my own favour. I had a great pleasure for several years together,
    in viewing and examining these noble remains of our ancestors. What I
    wrote about them, was for my private amusement, and that of friends.
    And I publish them only for the honour of my country, and in hopes that
    such a publication will not be unserviceable to religion; which is my
    ultimate view.</p>

  <p>Tho’ <i>Stonehenge</i> be the proudest singularity of this sort, in the
    world, as far as we know: yet there are so many others, manifestly
    form’d upon the same, or kindred design, by the same measure, and for
    the same purpose, all over the <i>Britanic</i> isles; that we can have
    no room to doubt of their being made by the same people, and that
    by direction of the <i>British</i> Druids. There are innumerable, from
    the land’s end in <i>Cornwall</i>, to the utmost northern promontory in
    <i>Scotland</i>, where the <i>Roman</i> power never reach’d. They are to be found
    in all the islands between <i>Scotland</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, isle of <i>Man</i>,
    all the <i>Orkney</i> islands, <i>&amp;c.</i> and numerous in <i>Ireland</i> itself.
    And there is no pretence, as far as I can see, for any other persons
    or nations being the founders of them. They are circles of stones,
    generally rude, of different diameters, upon elevated ground, barren,
    open heaths and downs; chiefly made of stones taken from the surface
    of the ground. There are no remembrances of the founders, any other
    than an uninterrupted tradition of their being sacred; that there is
    medicinal virtue in them; that they were made by the <i>Irish</i>; that
    they were brought from <i>Afric</i>; that they were high-places of worship;
    sanctuaries; bowing, adoring places; and what names they commonly have,
    intimate the same thing. And in many places the express remembrance and
    name of Druids remain, and the people bury their dead in or near them
    to this day, thinking them holy ground. Mr. <i>Toland</i> in his history of
    the Druids, p. 23. tells us, “In <i>Gealcossa</i>’s mount in <i>Inisoen</i> in
    the county of <i>Dunegal</i>, a Druidess of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> name lived; it signifies
    white-legg’d, according to the ancient manner in <i>Homer</i>’s time. On
    that hill is her grave and her temple, being a sort of diminutive
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, which the old <i>Irish</i>, at this day, dare not any way
    profane.” Many instances of this sort, of all these particulars, we
    have in our island: particularly the temple on <i>Temple-downs</i> by
    <i>Abury</i>. Whatever is dug up in or near these works are manifestly
    remains of the Druid times; urns, bones, ornaments of amber, glass
    beads, snake-stones, amulets, celts, flint-hatchets, arrow-heads, and
    such things as bespeak the rudest ages, the utmost antiquity, most
    early plantations of people that came into our island, soon after
    <i>Noah</i>’s flood. I have all the reason in the world to believe them
    an oriental colony of <i>Phœnicians</i>; at least that such a one came
    upon the first <i>Celtic</i> plantation of people here: which reasons will
    appear in the progress of this discourse. I suppose in matters of such
    extraordinary antiquity, it would be absurd to set about a formal
    demonstration; and those readers would be altogether unreasonable, that
    expect we prove every fact here, as they would do by living witnesses,
    before a court of judicature. When all is consider’d, that I have put
    together on this affair, a judicious person, I presume, will agree, I
    have made the matter sufficiently evident, and as much as the nature of
    things requires.</p>

  <p>In the times just preceding the coming of the <i>Romans</i> into <i>Britain</i>,
    the <i>Belgæ</i>, a most powerful colony from the <i>Gallic</i> continent, had
    firmly seated themselves all over the country, where <i>Stonehenge</i>
    is situate, quite to the southern sea; taking in the south part of
    <i>Wiltshire</i>, and all <i>Dorsetshire</i>. <i>Wiltshire</i> has its name from the
    river <i>Willy</i>, which in <i>Welsh</i> is <i>wyli</i>, in <i>Latin</i>, <i>vagire</i>, from
    its noise. A river of like name in <i>Northamptonshire</i>. Upon the former
    river at <i>Wilton</i>, probably liv’d the <i>Carvilius</i>, one of the four
    kings that fought <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, the picture of whose <i>tumulus</i> we
    have given towards the end. <span class="sidenote"><a href="#tab_XXXIIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XXXIV.</span></a></span> The <i>Belgæ</i> came into <i>Britain</i> upon the
    south, as other <i>Celtic</i> nations before had fix’d themselves from the
    east, <i>Kent</i>, the <i>Thames</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> such as the <i>Cantii</i>, <i>Segontiaci</i>,
    <i>Atrebates</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> so that in <i>Cæsar</i>’s time, all the south and east
    parts of <i>Britain</i> were dispossess’d of their original inhabitants,
    and peopled from the continent: and this very work of <i>Stonehenge</i>
    was in the hands of the <i>Belgæ</i>, who built it not. In my <i>itinerarium
    curiosum</i>, p. 181. I observ’d no less than four successive boundary
    ditches here, from the southern shore; which with good reason, I
    suppos’d, were made by the <i>Belgæ</i>, as they conquer’d the country by
    degrees, from the aboriginal inhabitants. This shews, they must have
    been a long while about it, that the <i>Britons</i> disputed every inch of
    ground with them, and that for two reasons; as well because of the
    extraordinary beauty and goodness of the country, as fighting <i>pro
    aris &amp; focis</i> for their great temple of <i>Stonehenge</i>: not to speak of
    that other greater temple, a little more northward, at <i>Abury</i>. The
    <i>Segontiaci</i> had got <i>Hampshire</i>, to the east of them, before, as far
    as the <i>Colinburn</i> river, and the <i>Atrebates</i>, <i>Berkshire</i>. The first
    ditch runs between the river of <i>Blandford</i>, formerly <i>Alauna</i>, and
    the river of <i>Bere</i>, the piddle in <i>Dorsetshire</i>, two or three miles
    south of it. The second runs to the north of <i>Cranborn</i> chase, upon the
    edge of <i>Wiltshire</i>, by <i>Pentridg</i>: it divides the counties of <i>Dorset</i>
    and <i>Wilts</i>. The third is conspicuous upon <i>Salisbury</i> plain, as we
    pass from <i>Wilton</i> to <i>Stonehenge</i>, about the two-mile stone, north
    of <i>Wilton</i>: it is drawn between the river <i>Avon</i> and the <i>Willy</i>,
    from <i>Dornford</i> to <i>Newton</i>. The fourth is the more famous <i>Wansdike</i>,
    of great extent. <i>Gwahan</i> in old <i>British</i> signifies <i>separatio</i>,
    <i>distinctio</i> guahanu <i>seperare</i>, and <i>that</i> undoubtedly gave name to
    the ditch. The method of all these ditches, is, to take the northern
    edge of a ridge of hills, which is always steep; the bank is on the
    south side. And in my itinerary, p. 134. I show’d a most evident
    demonstration, that it was made before the time of the <i>Romans</i>, in
    the passage of the <i>Roman</i> road down <i>Runway</i> hill. <a href="#tab_II"><span class="smcap">Tab. II.</span></a>
    <i>Wansdike</i> is the last advanc’d post of the <i>Belgæ</i> northwards, and
    that it was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>made after <i>Stonehenge</i> was built, is plain, because
    the stones that compose the work, were brought from <i>Marlborough</i>
    downs in north <i>Wiltshire</i>, beyond the dike; and as then in an enemy’s
    country. And most probably it was built before the <i>Belgæ</i> set footing
    in <i>Britain</i>, because of the great number of barrows or sepulchral
    <i>tumuli</i> about it, which, no doubt, were made for the burial of kings
    and great men.</p>

  <p>The stones of which <i>Stonehenge</i> is compos’d, beyond any controversy,
    came from those called the gray weathers, upon <i>Marlborough</i> downs
    near <i>Abury</i>; where is that other most wonderful work of this sort,
    which I shall describe in my next volume. This is 15 or 16 miles off.
    All the greater stones are of that sort, except the altar, which is of
    a still harder, as design’d to resist fire. The pyramidals likewise
    are of a different sort, and much harder than the rest, like those
    of that other Druid temple call’d <i>the Weddings</i>, at <i>Stanton-drew</i>
    in <i>Somersetshire</i>. Dr. <i>Halley</i> was at <i>Stonehenge</i> in the year
    1720, and brought a piece of it to the Royal Society. I examin’d it
    with a microscope. ’Tis a composition of crystals of red, green and
    white colours, cemented together by nature’s art, with opake granules
    of flinty or stony matter. The Doctor observ’d from the general
    wear of the weather upon the stones, that the work must be of an
    extraordinary antiquity, and for ought he knew, 2 or 3000 years old.
    But had the Doctor been at <i>Abury</i>, which is made of the same stones,
    he might well from the like argumentation conclude, that work as old
    again as <i>Stonehenge</i>, at least much older, and I verily believe it.
    Nevertheless the current of so many ages has been more merciful to
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, than the insolence of rapacious hands, (besides the
    general saccage brought upon the work of old) by the unaccountable
    folly of mankind, in breaking pieces off with great hammers. This
    detestable practice arose from the silly notion of the stones being
    factitious. But, alas! it would be a greater wonder to make them by
    art, than to carry them 16 miles by art and strength; and those people
    must be inexcusable, that deface the monument for so trifling a fancy.
    Another argument of vulgar incogitancy, is, that all the wonder of the
    work consists, in the difficulty of counting the stones; and with that,
    the infinite numbers of daily visitants busy themselves. This seems to
    be the remains of superstition, and the notion of magic, not yet got
    out of peoples heads, since Druid-times. But indeed a serious view of
    this magnificent wonder, is apt to put a thinking and judicious person
    into a kind of ecstacy, when he views the struggle between art and
    nature, the grandeur of that art that hides itself, and seems unartful.
    For tho’ the contrivance that put this massy frame together, must
    have been exquisite, yet the founders endeavour’d to hide it, by the
    seeming rudeness of the work. The bulk of the constituent parts is so
    very great, that the mortaises and tenons must have been prepar’d to
    an extreme nicety, and, like the fabric of <i>Solomon</i>’s temple, every
    stone tally’d; and neither axes nor hammers were heard upon the whole
    structure. Nevertheless there is not a stone at <i>Stonehenge</i>, that
    felt not, more or less, both ax and hammer of the founders. Yet ’tis
    highly entertaining to consider the judicious carelesness therein,
    really the grand gusto, like a great master in drawing, secure of the
    effect: a true master-piece. Every thing proper, bold, astonishing. The
    lights and shades adapted with inconceivable justness. Notwithstanding
    the monstrous size of the work, and every part of it; ’tis far from
    appearing heavy: ’tis compos’d of several species of work, and the
    proportions of the dissimilar parts recommend the whole, and it pleases
    like a magical spell. No one thinks any part of it too great or too
    little, too high or too low. And we that can only view it in its ruins,
    the less regret those ruins, that, if possible, add to its solemn
    majesty.</p>

  <p>The stones of the gray weathers are of a bastard sort of white marble,
    and lie upon the surface of the ground, in infinite numbers, and of
    all dimensions. They are loose, detach’d from any rock, and doubtless
    lay there ever since the creation. Being solid parts thrown out to the
    surface of the fluid globe, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> its rotation was first impress’d.
    All our Druid temples are built, where these sort of stones from
    the surface can be had at reasonable distances; for they are never
    taken from quarries. Here is a very good quarry at <i>Chilmark</i> in this
    country. <i>Salisbury</i> cathedral, and all the great buildings are thence;
    but ’tis a stone quite different to our work. It was a matter of much
    labour to draw them hither, 16 miles. My friend the reverend Dr.
    <i>Stephen Hales</i>, the excellent author of vegetable statics, and other
    works, computed them as follows. The stone at the upper end of the
    cell, which is fallen down and broke in half, is in length (says he) 25
    feet, in breadth 7 feet, and in thickness at a medium 3½, amounts to
    612 cubic feet. Now a cubic foot of <i>Hedington</i> stone weighs near 154¼
    pounds troy. If <i>Stonehenge</i> stone be of the same specific gravity,
    it will amount to 94,348 pounds, which is 31½ tuns. But if this be of
    the same specific gravity as <i>Burford</i> stone, which weighs to 155¾ the
    cubic foot, then it will weigh 95319 pounds troy, or 32 tuns. If it be
    equal to <i>Blaidon</i> stone, which is 187 pounds troy <i>per</i> cubic foot,
    then it weighs 114444 pounds troy, or 38 tuns. But I am sure that the
    stone is of considerably larger dimensions, than what Dr. <i>Hales</i> has
    stated it at, and that the sort of stone is much heavier than that of
    the largest specific gravity he speaks of, and that it amounts to more
    than 40 tuns, and requires more than 140 oxen to draw it; yet this is
    not the heaviest stone at the place.</p>

  <p>The notion we ought to entertain of <i>Stonehenge</i> is not a little
    enhanc’d, by the discovery I made from frequent mensurations there.
    It gave me the opportunity of finding out the standard and original
    measure, which the people us’d, who made this and all other works of
    this kind. And this precludes any tedious disputation against the
    opinion of authors; for whoever makes any eminent building, most
    certainly forms it upon the common measure in use, among the people
    of that place. Therefore if the proportions of <i>Stonehenge</i> fall
    into fractions and uncouth numbers, when measur’d by the <i>English</i>,
    <i>French</i>, <i>Roman</i>, or <i>Grecian</i> foot, we may assuredly conclude, the
    architects were neither <i>English</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>Roman</i> or <i>Greeks</i>. Thus,
    for instance, when the accurate <i>Greaves</i> tells us, the door of the
    <i>Pantheon</i> (which is of one stone) is of <i>English</i> foot-measure 19
    foot <span class="xsmall"><sup>602</sup>/<sub>1000</sub></span> within: should we not be apt to assert at first sight,
    that the architect in so costly a work, did not chuse his measures at
    random, but intended that this dimension should be 20 feet? When we
    consider this building is at <i>Rome</i>, and that it amounts to 20 <i>Roman</i>
    feet, must we not conclude, it was erected by the <i>Roman</i> standard?
    adding too, that all the rest of the dimensions of this stately
    structure fall aptly and judiciously into the same scale. So as long as
    any <i>vestigia</i> of St. <i>Paul</i>’s cathedral remain, the <i>English</i> foot,
    by which it was built, will easily be known. I must prepare the reader
    for a right understanding of our Druid edifices, by informing him,
    that <i>Stonehenge</i>, and all other works of this nature in our island,
    are erected by that most ancient measure call’d a cubit, which we read
    of in the holy scriptures, and in ancient profane authors. I mean the
    same individual measure, call’d the <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Phœnician</i>
    cubit; most probably deriv’d from <i>Noah</i> and <i>Adam</i>. ’Tis the same
    that the pyramids of <i>Egypt</i> and other their works are projected upon;
    the same as that of <i>Moses</i>’s tabernacle, <i>Solomon</i>’s temple, <i>&amp;c.</i>
    and we may reasonably pride ourselves in possessing these visible
    monuments of the old measure of the world. My predecessor Bishop
    <i>Cumberland</i> shows, enough to satisfy us, that the <i>Egyptian</i> and
    <i>Hebrew</i> measure was the same, tho’ he has not hit upon that measure,
    to a nicety. My friend and collegue Dr. <i>Arbuthnot</i> has been more
    successful, in applying it to such parts of the greater pyramid, as
    evidently establish its proportion, to our <i>English</i> foot, from the
    measures <i>Greaves</i> has left us: and shows it to be 20 inches and ⅘
    of <i>English</i> measure. Thus the Doctor observes the side of the greater
    pyramid at base, is 693 <i>English</i> feet; which amounts exactly to 400
    <i>Egyptian</i> cubits, a full and suitable number for such a square work,
    and without question the originally design’d measure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> the <i>stadium</i>
    of old. I have taken notice that <i>Inigo Jones</i> observ’d the like
    dimensions, in laying out the plot of <i>Lincoln</i>’s<i>-Inn-fields</i>. The
    Doctor adds many more instances, deduc’d in the same way, to confirm
    it. I add, that <i>Greaves</i> says, the lowermost steps of the pyramid are
    near 4 feet in height, which amounts to 2 cubits and 2 palms. They are
    3 foot in breadth, <i>i. e.</i> 1 cubit 4 palms. The length of the declining
    first entrance is 92 feet and an half, <i>i. e.</i> 55 cubits. The length
    of the next gallery is 110 feet, which amounts to 60 cubits. There is
    another gallery in the pyramid, of the same length. Mr. <i>Webb</i> says the
    diameter of <i>Stonehenge</i> is 110 feet. This would tempt one to suspect
    the same measure us’d in both. Thus the diameter of the like work at
    <i>Rowldrich</i> in <i>Oxfordshire</i>, describ’d by Dr. <i>Plot</i>, is 35 yards, <i>i. e.</i>
    110 feet, grossly measur’d. Father <i>Brothais</i> in his observations
    on upper <i>Egypt</i>, in our <i>Phil. Trans.</i> found a door-case made of one
    stone, in a magnificent building, it was 26½ feet in height, this is
    15 cubits. Dr. <i>Huntington</i>, in the same <i>Trans.</i> says, he found the
    sphynx standing by the northern pyramids to be 110 feet in circuit, <i>i. e.</i>
    60 cubits. <i>Ptolomy</i> in his IVth book, and <i>Pliny</i> XXXVI.——speak of
    the obelisk rais’d by king <i>Rameses</i> at <i>Heliopolis</i>, which Mr. <i>Webb</i>,
    p. 34. gives the length of in <i>English</i> feet, 136. This is 80 cubits.
    That which <i>Augustus</i> set up in the <i>circus maximus</i> at <i>Rome</i> upon
    reduction of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Webb</i> says, is 120 feet 9 inches, which amounts
    to 70 cubits. Another, <i>Augustus</i> set up in the <i>campus martius</i>,
    which he says is 9 foot higher, <i>i. e.</i> 5 cubits. He speaks again of
    that erected by <i>Fontana</i> before St. <i>Peter</i>’s, 81 feet, which was 50
    cubits. I suppose the base being injur’d, it was cut a little shorter.
    This at the base, he says, is 9 foot square, <i>i. e.</i> 5 cubits. The
    <i>Vatican</i> obelisk is 170 foot high, which is 100 cubits. 12 foot broad
    at bottom, which is 7 cubits; at top a third part less.</p>

  <p>Hence we gather, the measure of the shew-bread table of the <i>Jews</i>, a
    cubit and half in height, <i>Exod.</i> xxv. 23. It had a golden crown about
    it, meaning a moulding, or verge or cornish, as upon our tea-tables.
    <span lang="he">זר</span> <i>peripheria</i>, <i>corona</i>, because 12 loaves were to be pil’d upon it.
    It was 31 inches in height, that of our ordinary eating-tables. And we
    shall find by this same cubit divided into its 6 tophach’s or palms,
    all our Druid works are perform’d. ’Tis not to be wonder’d at, that it
    should come into <i>Britain</i>, with an eastern colony under the conduct
    of the <i>Egyptian</i>, <i>Tyrian</i>, <i>Phœnician Hercules</i>, (who was the same
    person) about <i>Abraham</i>’s time, or soon after, as I have good reasons
    to believe, which will be shown in its proper place.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">COME we to the name of <i>Stonehenge</i>, so call’d by our <i>Saxon</i>
    ancestors; an argument sufficient, they were not the builders of it;
    they would have called it by a more honourable name. Roꝺe henᵹenne is
    in <i>Saxon</i> a hanging-rod <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>or pole, <i>i. e.</i> a gallows; and <i>Stonehenge</i>
    is a stone gallows, called so from the hanging parts, architraves, or
    rather imposts, the more remarkable part; and which only can persuade
    people from thinking, the stones <i>grew</i> in the very place, (as they
    express it.) And so Mr. <i>Camden</i>, Dr. <i>Holland</i>, Mr. <i>Webb</i> and others
    think, of the wonderful work at <i>Abury</i>; because there are none of
    these overthwart stones, as here. Many are so astonished at the bulk
    of these stones, that measuring all art and power by their own, they
    had rather think, they sprouted up in their places, like mushrooms, at
    regular distances, in mathematical circles; than that they were plac’d
    there by human industry, for excellent purpose. But pendulous rocks
    are now called <i>henges</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>, and I have been informed of
    another place there called <i>Stonehenge</i>, being natural rocks. So that
    I doubt not, <i>Stonehenge</i> in <i>Saxon</i> signifies the hanging stones. In
    <i>Cornwall</i> is a Heath call’d now <i>Hengston</i> down, probably from such a
    work as ours, now demolished. It is in the hundred of <i>Easte</i>. And near
    it, is that other memorable Antiquity, composed of many upright stones,
    call’d the Hurlers, a Druid temple. The old <i>Britons</i> or <i>Welsh</i> call
    <i>Stonehenge</i> <i>choir gaur</i>, which some interpret <i>chorea gigantum</i>, the
    giants dance: I judge, more rightly <i>chorus magnus</i>, the great choir,
    round church, or temple. As Banchor (where probably was of old, another
    Druid temple) means the high temple. But they mistake it for <i>chorea</i>,
    <i>chwarae</i> <i>χuare</i>, a ball, dance; as <i>Necham</i> sings;</p>

  <p class="noindent">Mr. <i>Camden</i> defines the work <i>coronæ in modum</i>. The Latin <i>corona</i>
    a crown, <i>corolla</i> a <i>ghirland</i>, and the <i>British crown</i> comes from
    its circular form, as <i>côr</i> <i>chorus</i>. The armoric <i>Britons</i> call <i>cryn</i>
    <i>rotundus</i>, <i>kruin</i> the <i>Irish</i>. <i>Coryn</i> is the round tip of any thing,
    many such like words in all the <i>Celtic</i> dialects. The <i>chorus</i> of
    a building among <i>Roman</i> christians, became appropriate to the more
    sacred part, or east end of churches, always turn’d of a circular form;
    from the time of <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>. Thus all the churches in the
    holy land, thus the chapel in <i>Colchester</i> castle, and in the <i>Tower</i>
    of <i>London</i>, (both, in my opinion, built about his time) are round at
    the east end. The old <i>Britons</i> or <i>Welsh</i>, we find, had a notion of
    its being a sacred place, tho’ they were not the builders of it; for I
    take them to be the remains of the <i>Celtic</i> people that came from the
    continent, who chiefly inhabited <i>England</i>, at least the south part,
    when the <i>Romans</i> invaded the island, they are more particularly the
    remains of the <i>Belgæ</i>. I suppose their name <i>Welsh</i>, a corruption
    of <i>Belgæ</i>, <span lang="el">Οὐέλγαι</span> in greek, <span class="gothic" lang="de">Belgischen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="gothic" lang="de">Welschen</span> in german.
    <i>Strabo</i> IV. speaks of their way of making flannel, called <span lang="el">λαιναί</span>,
    for which our <i>Welsh</i> are so famous. <i>Strabo</i> gives the celtic word
    without the guttural aspirate, <i>chlæna</i> in latin. The most ancient
    inhabitants, the remains of the old <i>Phœnician</i> colony and primitive
    <i>Celts</i> who built <i>Stonehenge</i>, were the <i>Picts</i>, <i>Scots</i>, <i>Highland</i>
    and <i>Irish</i>, all the same people, tho’ perhaps differing somewhat in
    dialect, as in situation: no otherwise than a <i>Cumberland</i>-man and one
    of <i>Somersetshire</i> now. The <i>Cornish</i>, I suppose, some remains too,
    of the old oriental race. But at this very day in <i>Wales</i>, they call
    every antiquated appearance beyond memory, <i>Irish</i>. Upon view of land,
    that from before any ones remembrance appears to have been plow’d,
    or very ancient ruins of buildings, and the like, they immediately
    pronounce, That it was in the times of the <i>Irish</i>. The very same is
    observable in the north, of the <i>Picts</i> or <i>Pights</i>, as they pronounce
    it, gutturally, in the oriental fashion, which we cannot imitate. They
    call old foundations, <i>Pights</i> houses, &amp;c. Every thing is <i>Pictish</i>,
    whose origin they do not know. These people are conscious, that they
    are not the <i>Aborigines</i>, who by time and successive inundations, were
    forc’d northward and westward, into <i>Scotland</i> and <i>Ireland</i>. And also
    in the days of the <i>Romans</i>, such of the then inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> as would
    not submit to their gentile yoke, took the same road. The <i>Irish</i>
    therefore, or ancient <i>Scottish</i>, is the remnant of the <i>Phœnician</i>
    language, mixt with old <i>Biscayan</i> and <i>Gallic</i>, dialects of <i>Celts</i>;
    and some oriental, <i>Arabic</i> in particular: as Mr. <i>Toland</i> observes.
    And they are the descendants of the people who built <i>Stonehenge</i>, and
    the like Works. Whence spring the strange reports of these stones,
    coming from <i>Egypt</i>, from <i>Africa</i>, from <i>Spain</i>, from <i>Ireland</i>. As
    retaining some memory of the steps, by which the people who preceded
    their ancestors, travelled; nor they themselves, nor even the <i>Belgæ</i>
    pretending to be the builders of this wonderful work. For the <i>Belgæ</i>
    could not be ignorant of their own coming from the <i>Gallic</i> continent.</p>

    it was called the <i>Ambres</i>, or <i>Ambrose</i>, as the famous <i>main Ambre</i>

    this matter, I must beg the readers patience, till I come to the last
    chapter, and discourse of the antiquity of these works in general.</p>

  <p>So much at present as to the name of our fabrick; it is time to
    draw toward the sacred pile, and fancy ourselves walking upon this
    delightful plain:</p>

  <p class="noindent">nought can be sweeter than the air that moves o’re this hard and dry,
    chalky soil. Every step you take upon the smooth carpet, (literally)
    your nose is saluted with the most fragrant smell of <i>serpillum</i>, and
    <i>apium</i>, which with the short grass continually cropt by the flocks
    of sheep, composes the softest and most verdant turf, extremely
    easy to walk on, and which rises as with a spring, under ones feet.
    The following drawing <a href="#tab_III"><span class="smcap">Tab. III.</span></a> is a prospect taken from
    the king’s barrow, west from <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp, in the way from
    <i>Ambresbury</i> to <i>Stonehenge</i>, by the <i>Bristol</i> road. Tho’ the graver
    has not done it justice: yet it will give one a general notion of the
    situation of the place. It is admirably chosen, being in the midst of
    those wide downs, call’d <i>Salisbury</i> plain; between the river <i>Avon</i> to
    the east, and a brook that runs into the <i>Willy</i>, on the west. These
    two streams half round encompass it, at 2 miles distance, forming as
    it were a circular area, of 4 or 5 miles diameter, compos’d of gentle
    acclivities and declivities, open and airy. Yet agreeably diversify’d
    with the appearance of barrows, every where upon the edges of the
    highest grounds. Which very barrows are curious and entertaining, when
    view’d at hand, as well for the nicety and handsome turn of their
    forms, as for their great variety, and all within sight of the temple.
    These downs feed many flocks of sheep, and no doubt furnish’d the idea
    of <i>Thessalian</i> and <i>Arcadian</i> plains, to the noble <i>Sydney</i> residing
    at the neighbouring <i>Wilton</i>. The rivers are planted very thick with
    towns. Six miles south of <i>Stonehenge</i> is <i>Salisbury</i>, a mile nearer is
    <i>Sorbiodunum</i>, or old <i>Sarum</i>, by the side of which passes the <i>Roman</i>
    road <i>via Iceniana</i> reaching from <i>Norfolk</i>, into <i>Dorsetshire</i>. As
    this road goes southward, a mile beyond <i>Woodyates</i>, where it enters
    <i>Dorsetshire</i> and <i>Cranburn</i> chase, it passes over a heath where are
    many old barrows, like these on <i>Salisbury</i> plain. It happens there,
    to infringe upon one of the barrows, which luckily affords us a
    demonstration, of the road being made since those barrows; of which
    I took notice in my <i>itinerarium</i> p. 180. and further to gratify the
    curious have here inserted a print of it <a href="#tab_IIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. IV.</span></a> and may take
    the opportunity once for all to advertize them, of the disadvantage
    under which all drawings from these plains must appear. They are made
    for use and instruction, like mathematical figures, and cannot be
    expected much to please the eye; being form’d chiefly from bare lines,
    admitting no picture-like decoration.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

  <p>I have observ’d another similar proof of these works being older
    than the <i>Roman</i> times here, in that <i>Roman</i> road that goes from
    <i>Marlborough</i> to <i>Bath</i>. It is near <i>Abury</i>, and I have a print of
    it engrav’d, which will be exhibited, when I next publish an account
    of that great work. But in the former <i>plate</i> IV. I call those Druid
    barrows, which are often found on these plains: a circular trench,
    sometime of 100 foot diameter, with only a small tump of earth in the
    middle, under which there is commonly an urn. Sometime two or three of
    these little tumps or diminutive <i>tumuli</i> within one circle, which it
    is natural to suppose, were friends or relations. These circles are
    always excellently well mark’d out.</p>

  <p>The particular spot of ground where <i>Stonehenge</i> stands, is in the
    lordship of west or little <i>Ambresbury</i>: the possession of the
    reverend Mr. <i>Hayward</i>, who at present may be call’d the Archdruid of
    the island. ’Tis a delicate part of this large plain, with a gentle
    declivity from the south-west to the south and north-east. So that the
    soil, which is chalk, is perfectly dry and hard. Hence the infinite
    numbers of coaches and horses, that thro’ so many centuries have been
    visiting the place every day, have not obliterated the track of the
    banks and ditches. The water cannot possibly rest any where hereabouts.
    The founders consulted well for the stability of their work, and
    salubrity of the place. <i>Cæsar</i> informs us in his commentaries, B. G.
    <span class="smcap">VI.</span> 13. that among the Druids, “one has the supreme authority.
    When he is dead, whoever excels in dignity succeeds. But if there be
    more candidates, the Archdruid is chose by the votes of the Druids:
    and sometimes they fight for it. At a certain fix’d time of the year
    the <i>Gaulish</i> Druids meet, in the territories of the <i>Carnutes</i>, which
    country is in the middle of <i>Gaul, in a consecrated place</i>. Hither all
    persons from all quarters come, who have any controversy, and stand to
    their determination. The discipline of the Druids arose in <i>Britain</i>,
    and is said from thence to have been brought into <i>Gaul</i>. And now,
    they who design to be more thoroughly initiated therein, go over to
    learn.” Here in few lines the great author acquaints us with a vast
    fund of ancient history, and upon which whole volumes have been wrote.
    I observe no more from it at present, than that we may very reasonably
    conclude, the elegant and the magnificent structure of <i>Stonehenge</i> was
    as the metropolitical church of the chief Druid of <i>Britain</i>. This was
    the <i>locus consecratus</i> where they met at some great festivals in the
    year, as well to perform the extraordinary sacrifices and religious
    rites, as to determine causes and civil matters. <i>Cæsar</i> calls these
    appointments of the Druids in <i>Gaul</i> consecrated places, where probably
    was nothing but a circle of rude stones. Had he seen those of our
    island, an <i>Abury</i> or even a <i>Stonehenge</i>, he would scarce have given
    them the title of temples: he was not used to the old patriarchal
    way. But I reckon the true reading in that passage quoted from him,
    to be <i>loco consecrato</i>, not <i>luco</i>, which was put in by some bold
    transcriber, who had heard of the fondness of the Druids for groves.
    But how unfit is a grove for a great and public meeting upon civil
    affairs? And this for the excellency of its situation upon a vast
    plain, was well calculated for a publick meeting of those of the order,
    at an election of a new Archdruid. As <i>Cæsar</i>’s words give light to the
    work before us, so it confirms what the warlike author says, of the
    discipline being originally in <i>Britain</i>; which the critics upon the
    continent cannot bear, and vainly endeavour to spirit away <i>Cæsar</i>’s
    meaning. The very building of <i>Stonehenge</i>, to say nothing of other
    like works here, shows it was not in vain, that the youth of <i>Gaul</i>
    came to learn of men, who could contrive and execute so mighty a work.</p>

  <p><i>Stonehenge</i> stands not upon the very summit of a hill, but pretty near
    it, and for more than three quarters of the circuit you ascend to it
    very gently from lower ground. At half a mile distance, the appearance
    of it is stately and awful, really august. As you advance nearer,
    especially up the avenue, which is to the north-east of it, (which
    side is now most perfect) the greatness of its contour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> fills the
    eye in an astonishing manner. <a href="#tab_V"><span class="smcap">Tab. V.</span></a> is the front prospect
    from the entrance of the avenue. The stone that leans o’er the high
    altar appears thro’ the grand or principal entrance: because we stand
    upon lower ground. If the reader pleases to cast his eye upon
    <a href="#tab_XII"><i>Plate</i> XII.</a> there ’tis represented in orthography, (to speak technically)
    as here in prospect. Hence by this method of comparing the designs
    together, we may, without confusion, gather a true notion of the work.
    <i>Stonehenge</i> is a good deal more in diameter, than the outside of
    St. <i>Paul</i>’s cupola. And from a comparison of these two buildings,
    I was able to judge of the vanity of the architect of St. <i>Peter</i>’s
    at <i>Rome</i>, who in order to degrade the <i>Pantheon</i>, (whilst he was
    imitating it) boasted, he would set the <i>Pantheon</i> 200 foot high in the
    air, meaning the cupola there. But the architect of the <i>Pantheon</i>,
    <i>Valerius Ostiensis</i> (had he been alive) would have told him, that the
    vastness of the diameter in these cupola’s is lost by the very height.
    Whatever we would have admired, ought to be preserved as the largest
    dimension. Therefore <i>Valerius</i>, with admirable judgment, has made the
    outward breadth of the <i>Pantheon</i> one fifth part compleatly longer than
    its height, taken in front; but if we measure it sidewise, taking in
    the portico, the breadth to the height, is more than 6 to 4. By this
    means the wonder of the <i>Pantheon</i>, the curve or arch 150 <i>Roman</i> feet
    in diameter, remains. So the curve of <i>Stonehenge</i>, which is above 100
    <i>English</i> feet, appears extraordinary large and well proportion’d, upon
    a height of 18 foot, which reaches to the top of the outer cornish;
    that of the inner cornishes is but 24 foot high, at a medium. For the
    cornishes of the inner part of <i>Stonehenge</i>, or that which <i>Webb</i> calls
    the cell, are not all of equal height, of which in proper place. Thus
    both parts of the wonder is preserv’d, the greatness of the circuit of
    the whole work, the greatness and height of the parts that compose it;
    the height being one fourth of the diameter. The greatness too of the
    lights and shades in <i>Stonehenge</i>, as well as their variety arising
    from a circular form, gives it all possible advantage, and makes it
    deserve the appellation of,</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">as <i>Theocritus</i> and <i>Herodotus</i> generally call temples. And its
    situation is correspondent to the antient notion. <i>Pausanias</i> praises
    the <i>Tanagrei</i> in <i>Beotia</i>, for having their temples in clean and
    distinct area’s, distant from profane buildings and traffic.</p>

  <p><i>Stonehenge</i> is inclosed within a circular ditch. After one has pass’d
    this ditch, says the right reverend annotator to <i>Camden</i>, he ascends
    35 yards before he comes at the work itself. This measure is the same,
    as that which <i>Webb</i> calls 110 foot, the diameter of the work. For
    the area inclos’d by a ditch, wherein <i>Stonehenge</i> is situate, is in
    diameter three times the diameter of <i>Stonehenge</i>. See the <i>Plate</i>
    of the <i>area</i>. <a href="#tab_XXIII">XXIII</a>. Therefore the distance between the verge of
    the ditch within side, quite round, to the work of the Temple, is
    equal to the diameter of the Temple. The reader remembers what I
    promis’d, about the scale or measure whereby this work and all others
    of the Druids, is form’d; that ’tis the old <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Phœnician</i> or
    <i>Egyptian</i> Cubit, which compar’d with the <i>English</i> foot, amounts to
    20 inches and ⅘. Therefore I have drawn the ensuing comparison and
    proportion, between our <i>English</i> and <i>Hebrew</i> Scale; which is to
    accompany us in the future description. <a href="#tab_VI"><span class="smcap">Tab. VI.</span></a> the scale of
    cubits and feet compar’d. That I might not be suspected to favour an
    hypothesis, I produce other peoples measures, where I can find them
    in print, provided they be done with tolerable judgment and accuracy;
    for both are necessary in our case, with proper allowance. ’Tis not to
    be suppos’d, that in this work, the minuteness and extreme curiosity
    of <i>Desgodetz</i>, with which he measur’d the remains of old <i>Rome</i>,
    is expected, or even possible. For tho’ the stones are not chizel’d
    and squar’d, to such preciseness, as <i>Roman</i> works are; yet they are
    chizel’d, and are far from rude. Nevertheless every body has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
    skill, properly to measure them. For they are much impair’d by weather:
    much is knock’d off by wretched hands. Those stones that stand, are
    luxated various ways, by time and their own weight; by silly people
    digging about them, and by the unfortunate colony of rabbets lately
    translated thither. So that we may well say with <i>Claudian</i>,</p>

  <p class="noindent">I was forc’d to make many admeasurements and repeated, before I
    could obtain an exact ground-plot; and it requir’d much consideration
    to do it, and to find out the true scale by which it was compos’d, the
    Druid cubit, which they brought with them from the east. Therefore by
    the annexed scales, <a href="#tab_VI"><span class="smcap">Tab. VI.</span></a> which I have contriv’d to answer
    all lengths, the reader will most perfectly understand the subsequent
    description, and see the truth of my assertion: and may from thence
    be enabled to measure any other like works, in our islands, which I
    have not had the opportunity of viewing. It was the eastern way, in
    laying out a building, to use a staff of 6 cubits long. This was of a
    convenient, manageable length; and its divisions being half a dozen,
    suited well a reckoning by duodenaries. Thus in <i>Ezek.</i> xl. 3, 5.
    <i>Apoc.</i> xxi. 16. the angel that laid out the temple of <i>Solomon</i>, is
    described, as having a reed of 6 cubits (a measuring reed or cane) in
    his hand. This being the universal and first measure of antiquity,
    was in time spread all over the world. In particular, it became the
    <i>decempedum</i> of the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>; the common measuring
    standard. But ’tis remarkable, they alter’d the divisions, thinking
    it more artful and convenient to have them in less parts: and instead
    of 6 cubits, they made it consist of 10 feet. And by time and change,
    the whole measure became somewhat alter’d from the primitive. For the
    <i>Greek decempedum</i> was swell’d somewhat too long, as the <i>Romans</i>
    diminish’d theirs a little. <i>Ezekiel</i>’s reed is our 10 foot and 4
    inches ⅔; 400 cubits is the <i>stadium</i> of the ancients, or furlong,
    700 feet.</p>

  <p>When you enter the building, whether on foot or horseback and cast your
    eyes around, upon the yawning ruins, you are struck into an exstatic
    <i>reverie</i>, which none can describe, and they only can be sensible of,
    that feel it. Other buildings fall by piece meal, but here a single
    stone is a ruin, and lies like the haughty carcase of <i>Goliath</i>.
    Yet there is as much of it undemolished, as enables us sufficiently
    to recover its form, when it was in its most perfect state. There
    is enough of every part to preserve the idea of the whole. The next
    <i>Plate</i>, <a href="#tab_VII"><span class="smcap">Tab. VII.</span></a> the peep (as I call it) into the <i>sanctum
    sanctorum</i>, is drawn, at the very entrance, and as a view into the
    inside. When we advance further, the dark part of the ponderous imposts
    over our heads, the chasm of sky between the jambs of the cell, the odd
    construction of the whole, and the greatness of every part, surprizes.
    We may well cry out in the poet’s words</p>

  <p>The <i>vallum</i> of the ditch which incloses the <i>area</i>, or court, is
    inwards, and makes a circular terras; walking upon which, we take
    the foregoing prospects. The lowest part of the <i>area</i> is towards
    the entrance. The tops of all the circumjacent hills, or rather easy
    elevations, are cover’d o’re, as it were, with barrows, which cause an
    agreeable appearance; adorning the bare downs with their figures. And
    this ring of barrows reaches no further, than till you lose sight of
    the temple, or thereabouts. Stand at the grand entrance by the stone
    that lies upon the ground, and the view of the temple presents itself
    as in the <a href="#tab_V">Vth <i>Plate</i></a>, the front prospect of <i>Stonehenge</i>. Directly
    down the avenue, to the north-east, the apex of an hill terminates the
    horizon, between which and the bottom of a valley you see the <i>Cursus</i>,
    a work which has never yet been taken notice of. Being a space of
    ground included between two long banks going parallel east and west,
    at 350 foot distance, the length 10000 feet. This was design’d for the
    horse races and games, like the <i>Olympic</i>, the <i>Isthmian</i>, &amp;c. of the
    <i>Greeks</i>. But we shall speak more particularly of this afterwards. In
    the valley on this side of it, the strait part of the avenue terminates
    in two branches; that on the left hand, leads to the <i>Cursus</i>; that
    on the right goes directly up the hill, between two famous groups of
    barrows, each consisting of seven in number. The farthest, or those
    northward, I call the oldest king’s barrows; the hithermost are
    vulgarly called the seven king’s graves.</p>

  <p>If we walk a little to the left hand, <a href="#tab_VIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. VIII.</span></a> is presented.
    See the northern long barrow: on this side of which, the eye takes in
    the whole length of the <i>Cursus</i>. Many barrows at the end and on both
    sides of it. That mark’d P. was open’d by my Lord <i>Pembroke</i>, those
    mark’d S. were open’d by myself. What was discover’d therein will be
    treated of hereafter. Further to the west, the highest ground of that
    spot whereon <i>Stonehenge</i> stands, eclipses a distant view, and there
    are the nearest barrows planted with rabbets, which do much damage too
    at <i>Stonehenge</i>, and threaten no less than the ruin of the whole. Upon
    the <i>vallum</i> of <i>Stonehenge</i> is one of the stones there, which seems
    to be a small altar, for some kind of libations, and at the letter A.
    the mark of a cavity; of which more particularly, in the next page.
    The next or south-west prospect, <a href="#tab_IX"><span class="smcap">Tab. IX.</span></a> from <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    takes in the country from <i>Berwickbarn</i>, and my Lord <i>Pembroke</i>’s wood
    of <i>Groveley</i>, to <i>Salisbury</i> steeple: a chain of barrows reaching a
    6th part of the whole horizon. Many from the great quantity of these
    sepulchral <i>tumuli</i> here, injudiciously conclude, that there have been
    great battels upon the plain, and that the slain were bury’d there.
    But they are really no other than family burying-places, set near this
    temple, for the same reason as we bury in church-yards and consecrated
    ground. <i>Salisbury</i> steeple seen from hence, brings to my sorrowful
    remembrance, the great <i>Thomas</i> Earl of <i>Pembroke</i>, whose noble ashes
    are there deposited. He was patron of my studies, particularly those
    relating to <i>Stonehenge</i>. Virtue, piety, magnanimity, learning,
    generosity, all sublime qualities recommended and added to his
    illustrious descent. Glorious it will be for me, if these pages live to
    testify to another age, the intimacy he was pleased to honour me with.</p>

  <p class="noindent">In this <i>Plate</i>, the reader may remark another of the cavities
    within the <i>vallum</i>, to which that corresponds on the opposite diameter
    before hinted at.</p>

  <p>The south-east prospect finishes the circle, <a href="#tab_X"><span class="smcap">Tab. X.</span></a> looking
    towards the valley southward, where the rain-water passes, from the
    whole work of <i>Stonehenge</i>, the whole tract of the <i>Cursus</i> and the
    country beyond it, as far as north long barrow; and so is convey’d
    into the river <i>Avon</i> at <i>Lake</i>. That road between king barrow and the
    seven barrows is the way to <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> to <i>Ambresbury</i>.
    The barrow under those seven kings of later form, is that nearest to
    <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  <p>Doubtless in the sacrifices and ceremonies which were here practis’d,
    water was us’d, and I observe most of our Druid temples are set near
    rivers. The reason why <i>Stonehenge</i> was not set near a river, has
    hitherto effectually preserv’d it, this part being uninhabitable upon
    that account, and rather too far off a town for tillage. But when
    I curiously contemplated the beauty and convenience of this court,
    I observ’d two remarkable places, which plainly have a conformity
    with the two stones set upon the <i>vallum</i>; which stones puzzle all
    enquirers. These particulars seem to explain one another, and more
    especially by the help of a coin in <i>Vaillant</i>, tom. II. p. 240.
    for which reason I caus’d it to be engraven on that plate, <a href="#tab_XXIII"><span class="smcap">Tab.
    XXIII.</span></a> the <i>area</i> of <i>Stonehenge</i>. ’Tis a coin of <i>Philip</i> the
    <i>Roman</i> emperor, struck by the city of <i>Heliopolis</i> in <i>Cœlesyria</i>
    under mount <i>Libanus</i>, now call’d <i>Baldec</i>, where is an admirable
    ancient temple remaining, describ’d and pictur’d in <i>Maundrel</i>’s
    travels of the holy land. In the walls of it are two or three stones
    of an immense length, which seem to be the fragments of an obelisk,
    dedicated to the sun, whence the name of <i>Heliopolis</i>. The coin
    presents a temple built upon a rock: to which they ascend by steps.
    The temple is inclos’d in an <i>area</i> with a wall. On the left hand
    by the circuit of the <i>area</i> is a stone altar. A little further, is
    a great vase for water to be us’d in the sacrifices. The legend is
    <span class="smcap">COL</span><i>onia</i> <span class="smcap">IVL</span><i>ia</i> <span class="smcap">AVG</span><i>usta</i> <span class="smcap">FEL</span><i>ix</i>
    <span class="smcap">HEL</span><i>iopolitana</i>. Now the two cavities in the circuit of our
    <i>area</i>, very probably were the places where two great stone vases were
    set, and the two stones were two altars for some particular rites,
    which we don’t take upon ourselves to explain. See another coin II.
    in <i>Descamp</i>’s <i>selectiora numismata</i>, p. 23. which is to the same
    purpose. Those stones are set in their proper places in my scheme of
    the <i>area</i> of <i>Stonehenge</i>: and I leave them to the better conjectures
    of the learned in these matters. Mr. <i>Webb</i> fancies them the jambs of
    two portals of two entrances, besides the great entrance; and makes
    them favour his imaginary triangles, from which he forms the work of
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, upon a <i>Vitruvian</i> plan. And in order to bring this
    about, he draws one stone, that toward the east, or on the left hand,
    from the true and only entrance, no less than 120 foot out of its real
    place. No doubt, the reader will be surpriz’d at this, and the easier
    credit me, when I say his ground-plot in other parts, is very far from
    being exact. The reader will observe from my scheme, that the two
    semicircular hollows mark’d A A, wherein I suppose the water-vases were
    set, are plac’d alternatively, with the two stones: I don’t pretend to
    show why the Druids did so. But that stone standing, together with the
    upper A, and the center of the grand entrance by the stone that lies
    flat there, make an exact equilateral triangle; yet really have not the
    least relation to the scheme of the work of <i>Stonehenge</i> in general,
    or to the cell in particular. Nor do the stones, or those hollows,
    point out any other entrance cross the ditch into the <i>area</i>. So in the
    tabernacle of <i>Moses</i> and temple of <i>Solomon</i>, great vases in brass
    were set for water, in the court before the temple.</p>

    a circular form, is 110 foot in diameter. But to be precise, ’tis
    108 and somewhat more, and his own scale in his ground-plot shows
    the same. This is the diameter from outside to outside, which in our
    ground-plot is the principal diameter. The thickness of the stones
    of the outward circle, he says, p. 59. are 3 foot and an half. Hence
    the inner diameter becomes almost 102 feet <i>English</i>. If the reader
    pleases to measure 102 feet upon the comparative scales, which I gave
    of the <i>English</i> foot and <i>Hebrew</i> cubit, being the measure us’d by
    the Druids, or in the scales at the bottom of the ground-plot, he
    will find that it amounts exactly to 60 cubits. 30 cubits being the
    <i>radius</i> wherewith they struck the circle upon the turf, which is the
    inner circumference of that work. <i>That</i> sufficiently defin’d their
    ground-plot. For tho’ they intended in general, that the thickness of
    the stones of this outer circle should be 3 foot and a half; but to
    speak more properly, 2 cubits (which is the same measure) yet they
    were more careful of one side only, of that dimension. And the chief
    business being withinside this temple, they set the best face of the
    stones inwards, upon that ground-line; the other face was suited as
    well as the scantlings they could get, best answer’d. <i>Webb</i>’s 3 foot
    and a half is precisely 3 foot 5 inches, and somewhat more, making
    compleatly 2 Druid cubits, as you find by the scales. They that
    carefully view <i>Stonehenge</i>, will easily see, that the stones of the
    inside both of the outward circle and of the cell, are the smoothest,
    best wrought, and have the handsomest appearance. For so the polite
    architects of the eastern part of the world, bestow’d more elegance
    within their temples than without. Not as our modern <i>London</i> builders,
    who carve every moulding, and crowd every ornament, which they borrow
    out of books, on the outside of our publick structures, that they may
    more commodiously gather the dust and smoke. The truth is, good sense
    and observation of nature, produces the same ideas in all ages and all
    nations. Our Druids observ’d, that God almighty in forming the body of
    a man, made all the external parts great, bold, round, with ornament
    sufficient; but where the beauty chiefly consisted in the fitness of
    the proportions, in symmetry and plainness. In the inside, he has
    display’d all the <i>minutiæ</i> of divine skill. They have done the like,
    according to their way, in <i>Stonehenge</i>. So even as to the outward
    appearance, I find they took care to set those stones that had the
    best outward face, toward the front or entrance. And to embarrass the
    general scheme of the work, they made use of two centers instead of
    one, but 2 cubits distance from one another; perhaps to make the thing
    intricate and as magical: besides the advantage it gives to the oval
    form of the included cell.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

  <p>Observe, in laying down the ground-plot and projecting this outer
    circle, we said it was 110 feet, (gross measure) in diameter. We
    remember what is before-mention’d, that the learned <i>Greaves</i> measur’d
    two galleries in the greater pyramid, in like manner, each 110 feet. So
    the bishop of <i>London</i> says, from the grand entrance of <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    to the work is 35 yards: so he says the diameter of the circle at
    <i>Rowldrich</i> in <i>Oxfordshire</i>, is 35 yards: all this while 60 Druid or
    <i>Egyptian</i> cubits are meant. So the length of <i>Solomon</i>’s temple was 60
    cubits, whereof the <i>Ædes</i> 40 cubits, the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> 20.</p>

  <p>The intention of the founders of <i>Stonehenge</i> was this. The whole
    circle was to consist of 30 stones, each stone was to be 4 cubits
    broad, each interval 2 cubits. 30 times 4 cubits is twice 60: 30 times
    2 cubits is 60. So that thrice 60 cubits compleats a circle whose
    diameter is 60. A stone being 4 cubits broad, and 2 cubits thick is
    double the interval, which is a square of 2 cubits. Change the places
    between the stones and their intervals, and it will make a good
    ground-plot for a circular portico of <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i> work. For
    supposing these intervals to be square plinths of 2 cubits each side,
    and columns properly set upon them: it will admit of 3 diameters for
    the intercolumniation, which is the diastyle manner in architecture.
    But to talk of pycnostyle with Mr. <i>Webb</i>, and call these stones of
    ours pillars or pillasters, where they are twice as broad as the space
    between them, and to call this an order, is monstrous.</p>

  <p>Thus a stone and an interval in this outward circle of <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    makes 3 squares; 2 allotted to the stone, 1 to the interval; which
    for stability and beauty withal, in such a work as ours, is a good
    proportion. The curiosity of the work, and the general orthography
    of the outward circle, I have design’d in <a href="#tab_XII"><i>Plate</i> XII.</a> and it may be
    seen in the seven stones now remaining at the grand entrance. <span class="sidenote"><a href="#tab_V"><span class="smcap">Tab. V.</span></a></span> Which
    show what strictly was the intent of the founders, and where they
    took the liberty to relax of that strictness, and that with judgment;
    so as to produce a good effect. I shall explain it from Mr. <i>Webb</i>’s
    own measures, that I may give the truth its full advantage. P. 59. he
    says, the stones which made the outward circle are 7 foot in breadth.
    Observe that 7 foot makes 4 cubits of the Druids. He says, they are 15
    foot and a half high. You find that exactly 9 cubits. P. 61. he says,
    the architraves lying round about upon them, are 2 foot and a half
    high, <i>i. e.</i> our cubit and half. He mentions their breadth to be 3
    foot and half, equal to the thickness of the upright, <i>i. e.</i> our two
    cubits. They are jointed in the middle of each perpendicular stone.
    Hence tho’ he has not mention’d the length of these architraves, we
    gather them to be 6 cubits long. This is spoke of their inward length,
    for outwardly they must needs be somewhat longer, as being an ark of a
    larger circle. I must observe about these architraves, as Mr. <i>Webb</i>
    calls them, that they are more properly call’d imposts or cornishes;
    for they are not made to support any thing above them, as is the nature
    of an architrave, but for the stability and ornament of what supports
    them, which is the nature of imposts and cornishes. Tho’ these bodies
    of stone here, never had or were intended to have, any mouldings upon
    them, like <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> works; they are wrought perfectly plain,
    and suitable to the stones that support them. I observe further, the
    chizeling of our upright stones, is only above ground. For the 4 or
    5 foot in length below ground, is left in the original natural form.
    And that the upright stones are made very judiciously to diminish a
    little, every way; so that at top they are but 3 cubits and a half
    broad, and so much narrower as to suffer their imposts, to hang over a
    little, or project (in properer terms) over the heads of the uprights,
    both within side and without. By this means these uprights are in much
    less danger of falling or swerving any way: and the imposts, which are
    not broader than the thickness of the stones at bottom, which support
    them, have a graceful effect, by projecting a little, without danger
    of surcharging them. We see here plain, natural, easy geometry, what
    we may call the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>first rudiment of art, deduc’d from common reason:
    but they that can find any <i>Roman</i> delicacy herein, must, I freely own,
    have a much nicer eye and taste, than I can pretend to. The Druids
    had, from patriarchal times, made their altars or temples of rude
    unpolish’d stones. But now hearing, probably from <i>Phœnician</i> traders,
    of the glories of <i>Solomon</i>’s temple, at least of other temples made
    artfully in imitation of it; such as those of <i>Sesostris</i> in <i>Egypt</i>,
    and others about <i>Phœnicia</i>: they thus made a small approach to square
    scantlings and stones wrought. And this seems to have been the first
    and the last work of theirs of this kind, that I can hear of, either
    in the <i>Britanic</i> isles, or on the continent. And no doubt but it
    must give them so high a reputation, that even the people of <i>Gaul</i>
    themselves could not help owning to <i>Cæsar</i>, that the discipline of
    these men was first begun here, and carry’d on with such success, that
    they sent their youth from the continent hither, as to an academy, to
    be initiated in their learning. We are not to suppose these words are
    to be strictly taken, as if the Druids here began their institution:
    but that being an oriental manner of religion, and much different from
    that on the <i>Gallic</i> continent, what they had of it there, was deriv’d
    from <i>Britain</i>. It appear’d as much new to them, who were chiefly
    idolaters, as in many ages preceding, <i>Abraham</i>’s religion appear’d new
    to the inhabitants of <i>Phœnicia</i> and <i>Egypt</i>: who were then not much
    tinctur’d with idolatry. Nor, probably, had the Druids much opportunity
    of building another such work, as <i>Stonehenge</i>, between its foundation
    and the <i>Roman</i> times. Because, I apprehend, the encroachments of
    the <i>Gallic</i> nations from the continent, seating themselves in
    <i>Britain</i>, about 200 years before <i>Cæsar</i>’s invasion, had molested the
    Druids much, in these southern counties: and drove them with the old
    <i>Britons</i>, farther northward and westward. But of this we will treat
    more particularly afterwards, when we offer our opinion, of the time
    when it was made.</p>

    <p>In the orthographic plate, <a href="#tab_XII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XII.</span></a> we may see the strict
    geometry of the work of this outward circle, and the artful variation
    therefrom, in order to make the aperture of the grand entrance
    somewhat wider than the rest. Mr. <i>Webb</i> does not take notice of this
    particular; and he might have triumph’d in it. For ’tis no less than a
    <i>Vitruvian</i> rule, to relax the intercolumniation just in the middle of
    the portico, in the front of a temple, and over-against the door. He
    speaks of it in <i>Lib.</i> III. 2. when talking of the <i>Eustyle ratio</i>, the
    best for use, appearance and strength: he directs the intercolumniation
    to be of two diameters and ¼; but the middle intercolumniation of
    three diameters. By which means the approach to the door will be much
    more commodious, and nothing diminish’d of beauty in aspect. And this
    is the reality of the case before us.</p>

  <p>But alas, our <i>British</i> priests knew nothing of <i>Vitruvius</i>; they
    deduc’d this knack from an authority much ancienter than him, <i>viz.</i>,
    from pure natural reason, and good sense. Nor does this hurt the whole
    of the work. The aperture ought strictly to have been two cubits equal
    to the rest, but they advanc’d it to two cubits and a half. This
    only crowds the next intervals on each side a small matter nearer,
    the rest preserving their true distance quite round. And in the work
    itself, ’tis obvious enough to the naked eye. Again, there is another
    remarkable particular observ’d by our priests. Because the aperture of
    the principal entrance we are speaking of, is wider than the rest: they
    have made the impost over it thicker than the rest, and ’tis equally
    obvious to the naked eye. This was the more effectually to secure it
    from breaking. But this additional thickness they have put below. They
    were sensible it would have produc’d an ill effect at top, by breaking
    the line of that noble cincture. It must be own’d this was extremely
    well adjusted. And the breadth of the stone that hangs over head in
    this place is astonishing. See <a href="#tab_VII"><i>Plate</i> VII.</a> call’d a peep into the
    <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>. I had the greatest pleasure imaginable, in the
    year 1723, <i>July</i>, in being here for several days together, with the
    learned <i>Heneage</i> Lord <i>Winchelsea</i>. I have just reason to boast of
    that intimacy he indulg’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> me in; and his memory must for ever be dear
    to me, for his noble qualities. My Lord and I were very careful in
    taking the measures of <i>Stonehenge</i>; and with great grief we observ’d,
    the stones here represented in that <i>Plate</i>, and <a href="#tab_V"><span class="smcap">Tab. V.</span></a> the
    front view, to be much deviated forwards from their true perpendicular,
    and in the utmost danger of falling. ’Tis to be fear’d some indiscreet
    people have been digging about the great entrance, with ridiculous
    hopes of finding treasure, and loosen’d thereby the chalky foundation.
    We found by measure, that the upper edge of the impost overhangs no
    less than 2 foot 7 inches, which is very considerable in a height of
    18. The whole breadth at the foundation is but 3 foot and a half. And
    this noble front is now chiefly kept up by the masonry of the mortaise
    and tenon of the imposts.</p>

  <p>Thro’ the middle of the principal entrance, runs the principal line of
    the whole work; the diameter from north-east to south-west. This line
    cuts the middle of the altar, length of the cell, the entrance, the
    entrance into the court, and so runs down the middle of the avenue, to
    the bottom of the valley for almost 2000 feet together. This is very
    apparent to any one at first sight, and determines this for the only
    principal entrance of the temple. All the other intervals of the stones
    of the outer circle, have no preheminence in any respect. There is no
    such thing as three entrances, which Mr. <i>Webb’s</i> scheme suggests. He
    might as well have pretended there are 6, for so many points of his
    triangles meet in intervals, at the verge of the outer circle. Upon
    this line are all the principal centers that compose the work, it
    varies a small matter from true north-east.</p>

  <p>The contrivance of our artificers in making mortaises and tenons,
    between the upright stones and the imposts is admirable, but so
    contrary to any practice of the <i>Romans</i>, that it alone is enough to
    disqualify their claim to the work. Much judgment and good sense is
    shewn in the management of them. The centers of the tenons are 2 cubits
    distant from each other, upon each upright. By this means there is
    4 cubits distance from the center of the tenon of one stone, to the
    center of the tenon of its next neighbour, across the intervals, or in
    one impost. Divide the upper face of an upright into its 2 squares, the
    center of a tenon is in the center of that square. Divide the under
    face of an impost, into its 3 squares, the correspondent mortaises are
    in the centers of the two outermost squares, and this was the strict
    geometrical method us’d by the founders: so that the stones fitted, as
    soon as plac’d in their true situations. These tenons and mortaises
    of this outer circle are round, and fit one another very aptly. The
    tenons and mortaises, are 10 inches and a half in diameter, which is
    3 palms, or half a cubit. They rather resemble half an egg, than an
    hemisphere. These most effectually keep both uprights and imposts from
    luxation, and they must have used great labour that threw them down.
    Sir <i>Robert Sibbald</i> speaks of a rocking stone in <i>Ireland</i>, contriv’d
    with mortaise and tenon like ours: of which Mr. <i>Toland</i> gives us an
    account, with other like, the works of the Druids.</p>

  <p>The whole height of upright and impost is 10 cubits and a half. The
    uprights 9 cubits, the impost 1 cubit and a half, so that the impost is
    a 6th part of the height of the upright. If we measure on the outside,
    the collective breadth of two upright stones, and the interval between
    them, ’tis 10 cubits and a half equal to the whole height; and the
    interval is half the breadth of a stone, the thickness of a stone is
    half its breadth. That impost which lies over the grand entrance,
    we said, was deeper and longer than the rest. <i>Abraham Sturges</i> an
    architect, and myself measured it, in presence of Lord <i>Winchelsea</i>.
    Its middle length is 11 feet 10 inches, which is 6 cubits 4 palms;
    2 foot 11 inches high, which is 1 cubit 4 palms. They have likewise
    added a little to its breadth, more than the rest, being 3 foot 9
    inches, which is 2 cubits and a palm. <i>N. B.</i> The scale of my drawing
    is adapted for the inside of the circle, upon which the proportions in
    geometry are built: so that the outward <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>breadths of the uprights and
    lengths of the imposts are somewhat more, than by the scale appears
    there. The intelligent reader knows this must be the consequence, in
    arks of a larger circle.</p>

  <p>Nothing in nature could be of a more simple idea than this vast circle
    of stones, and its crown-work or <i>corona</i> at top; and yet its effect
    is truly majestic and venerable, which is the main requisite in sacred
    structures. A single stone is a thing worthy of admiration, but the
    boldness and great relievo of the whole <i>compages</i>, can only be rightly
    apprehended, from view of the original. On the outside, the imposts
    are rounded a little to humour the curvity of the circle, and within
    they are strait, tho’ they ought to be a little curv’d. This makes
    them somewhat broader in the middle, than at the end, and broader
    than the 2 cubits, which is the thickness of the upright stones, upon
    an ichnography. So that within, the crown-work makes a polygon of 30
    sides. But this little artifice without debasing the beauty of the
    work in the least, adds much strength to the whole, and to the imposts
    in particular. We may guess their proportions are well chose, when so
    many of them are thrown down by violence, and not broke in the fall.
    And their greater breadth in the middle, or that part that covers the
    intervals, adds to the solemnity of the place, by the shadow they
    present at the bottom. The whole affair of jointing in this building
    is very curious, and seems to be the oldest and only specimen of this
    kind of work in the world. There is nothing, that I know of, comes in
    competition with it, but the celebrated ruins at <i>Persepolis</i>. <a href="#tab_XXXV"><span class="smcap">Tab.
    XXXV.</span></a> It is compos’d of great stones laid across one another, as
    <i>Stonehenge</i>: but not with mortaise and tenon. The vulgar and learned
    too, generally take it for the remains of the palace of the <i>Persian</i>
    monarchs, burnt by <i>Alexander</i> the great; but it is really an open
    temple like ours, and made much in the same manner. But the stones are
    well squar’d, ornamented with mouldings and carvings, and the whole of
    them are squares, not round works as here. <i>Persepolis</i> is a mixture,
    between the ancient patriarchal round form of open temples, and the
    square form introduc’d under the <i>Jewish</i> dispensation, in opposition
    to the former, which were generally degenerated into idolatrous
    purposes. But of this I shall speak more perhaps hereafter, when I
    treat of the most ancient temples.</p>

  <p>Of the outer circle at <i>Stonehenge</i> which in its perfection consisted
    of 60 stones, 30 uprights and 30 imposts, there are more than half
    the uprights, <i>viz.</i> 17 left standing. 11 of these uprights remain,
    continuous, by the grand entrance, five imposts upon them. One upright
    at the back of the temple or on the south-west, leans upon a stone of
    the inner circle. There are six more lying upon the ground, whole or
    in pieces. So that 24 out of 30 are still visible at the place. There
    is but one impost more in its proper place. And but two lying upon the
    ground, so that 22 are carried off. Hence I infer, this temple was not
    defac’d when christianity prevailed. But some rude and sacrilegious
    hands carried the stones away for other uses. However it cannot but be
    the highest pleasure imaginable to a regular mind, to walk round and
    contemplate the stately ruins which I have endeavour’d to preserve in
    the outside views, such as <a href="#tab_XIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XIII.</span></a> from the south-west, and
    so of the rest. But we may say with <i>Lucan</i>,</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MANY drawings have been made and publish’d, of <i>Stonehenge</i>. But
    they are not done in a scientific way, so as may prove any point, or
    improve our understanding in the work. I have therefore drawn four
    architectonic orthographies: one, <a href="#tab_XII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XII.</span></a> is of the front
    and outside: three are different sections upon the two principal
    diameters of the work. These will for ever preserve the memory of the
    thing, when the ruins even of these ruins are perish’d; because from
    them and the ground-plot, at any time, an exact model may be made.
    <span class="smcap">Tab. <a href="#tab_XIIII">XIV</a>, <a href="#tab_XV">XV</a>, <a href="#tab_XVI">XVI</a>.</span> these orthographies show the primary
    intent of the founders; they are the designs, which the Druids made,
    before they put the work in execution. And by comparing them with
    the drawings correspondent, of the ruins, we gain a just idea of the
    place, when it was in its perfection. But now as we are going to enter
    into the building, it will be proper again to survey the ground-plot,
    <a href="#tab_XI"><span class="smcap">Tab. XI.</span></a> which is so different from that publish’d by Mr.
    <i>Webb</i>. Instead of an imaginary hexagon, we see a most noble and
    beautiful ellipsis, which composes the cell, as he names it, I think
    <i>adytum</i> a proper word. There is nothing like it, to my knowledge,
    in all antiquity; and ’tis an original invention of our Druids, an
    ingenious contrivance to relax the inner and more sacred part, where
    they perform’d their religious offices. The two outward circles do not
    hinder the sight, but add much to the solemnity of the place and the
    duties, by the crebrity and variety of their intervals. They that were
    within, when it was in perfection, would see a most notable effect
    produc’d by this elliptical figure, included in a circular <i>corona</i>,
    having a large hemisphere of the heavens for its covering.</p>

  <p>Somewhat more than 8 feet inward, from the inside of this exterior
    circle, is another circle of much lesser stones. In the measure of
    the Druids ’tis five cubits. This circle was made by a radius of 24
    cubits, drawn from the common centers of the work. This struck in the
    chalk the line of the circumference wherein they set these stones.
    The stones that compose it are 40 in number, forming with the outward
    circle (as it were) a circular portico: a most beautiful walk, and of
    a pretty effect. Somewhat of the beauty of it may be seen in
    <a href="#tab_XVII"><i>Plate</i> XVII.</a> where, at present, ’tis most perfect. We are impos’d on, in Mr.
    <i>Webb</i>’s scheme, where he places only 30 stones equal to the number
    of the outer circle, the better to humour his fancy of the dipteric
    aspect, p. 76. He is for persuading us, this is a <i>Roman</i> work compos’d
    from a mixture of the plainness and solidness of the Tuscan order,
    with the delicacy of the Corinthian. That in aspect ’tis <i>dipteros
    hypæthros</i>, that in manner ’tis <i>pycnostylos</i>; which when apply’d
    to our antiquity, is no better than playing with words. For suppose
    this inner circle consisted of only 30 stones, and they set as in his
    scheme, upon the same <i>radius</i>, as those of the outer: what conformity
    has this to a portico properly, to an order, <i>tuscan</i>, <i>corinthian</i>
    or any other, what similitude is there between these stones and a
    column? where one sort is square oblong, the other opposite (by his own
    account) pyramidal. Of what order is a column, or rather a pilaster,
    where its height is little more than twice its diameter? Where is the
    base, the shaft, the capital, or any thing that belongs to a pillar,
    pillaster or portico? the truth and fact is this. The inner circle
    has 40 stones in it. Whence few or none but those two intervals upon
    the principal diameter, happen precisely to correspond with those of
    the outer circle. Whereby a much better effect is produc’d, than if
    the case had been as <i>Webb</i> would have it. For a regularity there,
    would have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>trifling and impertinent. Again, Mr. <i>Webb</i> makes
    these stones pyramidal in shape, without reason. They are truly flat
    parallelograms, as those of the outer circle. He says, p. 59. they
    are one foot and a half in breadth, but they are twice as much. Their
    general and designed proportion is 2 cubits, or two cubits and a half,
    as they happen’d to find suitable stones. A radius of 23 cubits strikes
    the inner circumference: of 24 the outer. They are, as we said before,
    a cubit thick, and 4 cubits and a half in height, which is above 7
    foot. This was their stated proportion, being every way the half of the
    outer uprights. Such seems to have been the original purpose of the
    founders, tho’ ’tis not very precise, neither in design, nor execution.
    In some places, the stones are broader than the intervals, in some
    otherwise: so that in the ground-plot I chose to mark them as equal,
    each 2 cubits and a half. There are scarce any of these intire, as to
    all these dimensions; but from all, and from the symmetry of these
    <i>Celtic</i> kind of works, which I have been conversant in, I found this
    to be the intention of the authors. ’Tis easy for any one to satisfy
    themselves, they never were pyramidal; for behind the upper end of the
    <i>adytum</i>, there are three or four left, much broader than thick, above
    twice; and not the least semblance of a pyramid. I doubt not but he
    means an obelisk, to which they might some of them possibly be likened,
    but not at all to a pyramid. Nor indeed do I imagine any thing of an
    obelisk was in the founders view; but the stones diminish a little
    upward, as common reason dictates they ought to do. Nor need we bestow
    the pompous words of either pyramid, or obelisk upon them. For they
    cannot be said to imitate, either one or other, in shape, use, much
    less magnitude: the chief thing to be regarded, in a comparison of this
    sort. The central distance between these stones of the inner circle,
    measured upon their outward circumference, is 4 cubits. I observe
    further, that the two stones of the principal entrance of this circle,
    correspondent to that of the outer circle, are broader and taller,
    and set at a greater distance from each other, being rather more than
    that of the principal entrance in the outer circle. It is evident too,
    that they are set somewhat more inward than the rest; so as that their
    outward face stands on the line that marks the inner circumference of
    the inner circle. I know no reason for all this, unless it be, that
    the outside of these two stones, is the outside of the hither end of
    the ellipsis of the <i>adytum</i>: for so it corresponds by measure upon
    the ground-plot. This is apparent, that they eminently point out the
    principal entrance of that circle, which is also the entrance into
    the <i>adytum</i>. For five stones on this hand, and five on that, are as
    it were the <i>cancelli</i> between the <i>sanctum</i> and <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>,
    if we may use such expressions. ’Tis scarce worth mentioning to the
    reader, that there never were any imposts over the heads of these
    stones of the inner circle. They are sufficiently fasten’d into the
    ground. Such would have been no security to them, no ornament. They are
    of a harder kind of stone than the rest, as they are lesser; the better
    to resist violence.</p>

  <p>There are but nineteen of the whole number left; but eleven of
    them are standing <i>in situ</i>. There are five in one place standing
    contiguous, three in another, two in another. The walk between these
    two circles, which is 300 foot in circumference, is very noble and very
    delightful. Probably it gave <i>Inigo Jones</i> the idea of designing that
    fine circular portico, which is one great beauty, among many, in his
    drawings for <i>White-hall</i>, publish’d lately from the originals by my
    Lord <i>Burlington</i>; who has a true notion of the extraordinary merit of
    that great man: and very commendably has reviv’d his memory. Such a
    circular portico put in execution, would have a marvellous effect, much
    exceed a common gallery in use, because ’tis a perpetual walk, without
    turning back, and well becomes a royal residence. The best view of
    this sort, to be had from our work, is from the north, as in <a href="#tab_XVII"><span class="smcap">Tab.
    XVII.</span></a> the reader cannot but observe, how little pretence here is
    for an imitation of <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i> portico’s, notwithstanding the
    grand and agreeable curve of the outward circle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> But when we see the
    disproportion of the inner circle in regard to any purpose of this
    sort, we must own the invention of <i>Hermogenes</i> in contriving the
    <i>pseudo-dipteros</i>, is here apply’d with an ill grace. The founders of
    <i>Stonehenge</i> cou’d have no need of make-shifts for want of room on
    <i>Salisbury</i> plain. Or how could a concentric row of little stones, or
    pillars if he will so have it, bear any resemblance to the contrivance
    of <i>Hermogenes</i>, which consisted in having none; in taking away the
    whole inner row of pillars, so as to add to the convenience of room,
    and preserve the aspect, at the same time? Most undoubtedly the Druids
    had no further meaning in it, than to make use of the even numbers of
    30 greater stones, and 40 lesser stones; and this was to produce a more
    perplexed variety, by the interstices having no regard to one another.
    So far were they from having a notion of <i>Grecian</i> beauty, in the
    pillars of circular portico’s being set on the same <i>radius</i>; pillar
    answering to pillar, intercolumniation to intercolumniation. And this
    will be shown repeatedly in the progress of this work, to be the common
    practice of the Druids in other like instances.</p>

  <p>But when we consider the cell, as Mr. <i>Webb</i> names it, we find him
    guilty of great disingenuity, in ill conceiving the form of it, and in
    distorting his ground-plots, to colour it over the better. The minute
    you enter this <i>adytum</i>, as in <a href="#tab_XVIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XVIII.</span></a> you discover ’tis
    not a hexagon, nor ever was intended for one, and there can be no
    greater absurdity than to imagine it one. It is in truth compos’d of
    certain <i>compages</i> of stones, which I shall call <i>trilithons</i>, because
    made, each of two upright stones, with an impost at top: and there
    are manifestly 5 of these <i>trilithons</i> remaining. But the naked eye
    easily discovers, they are very far from making 5 sides of a hexagon.
    They cannot be brought to any approach, of a truly circular polygon.
    3 <i>trilithons</i> of the 5 are remaining entire, 2 are ruin’d indeed, in
    some measure, but the stones remain <i>in situ</i>. And nothing is easier,
    than to take the ground-plot, from symmetry and correspondency. We
    see the two <i>trilithons</i> on the wings or sides of the <i>adytum</i>,
    are set almost in a strait line, one of another; when in a hexagon
    form, they ought to make a considerable angle. If you examine them
    trigonometrically, the true angle of an hexagon is 120 degrees, but
    here is an angle of near 150. And by making it an hexagon, he supposes
    one <i>trilithon</i> entirely gone, <i>that</i> nearest the grand entrance, when
    there is not the least appearance that ever there were such stones
    there. No cavity in the earth, no stump or fragment visible, nor is
    it easy to imagine, how 3 stones of so vast a bulk could have been
    clean carried away, either whole or in pieces. There is no room for
    them to have been carried away whole, no traces of their having been
    thrown down, broke in pieces and so carried away. This outer side of
    the work being the most perfect of the whole. Of the ruins of the other
    <i>trilithons</i>, there is not the least part wanting. What has been thrown
    down and broke, remains upon the spot. But this <i>trilithon</i> in dispute,
    must needs have been spirited away, by nothing less than <i>Merlin’s</i>
    magic, which erected it, as the monks fable. Besides, if it were still
    standing, it would be very far from making this <i>adytum</i> a regular
    hexagon, to which he has accommodated his <i>peripteros</i> scheme: p. 87.
    Further, granting it was a regular hexagon, it would be very far from
    corresponding with that scheme, or have the least appearance, of its
    being taken from such a one. For our editor there, has converted the
    cell quite from the nature of that at <i>Stonehenge</i>. He has made the
    upper end of his cell at the letter H opposite to the grand entrance G,
    not a <i>trilithon</i> as it is notoriously at <i>Stonehenge</i>, but an angular
    interval between 2 <i>trilithons</i>. It is not the side of the figure,
    but the angle. Whereas it is most notorious at <i>Stonehenge</i>, that the
    upper end of the <i>adytum</i> opposite to the grand entrance, and to the
    whole length of the avenue and entrance between it and the <i>area</i>,
    is a <i>trilithon</i>; not an angle or interval. And that <i>trilithon</i> is
    exceeding stately, tho’ in ruins, one of the upright stones being
    fallen, the other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>leaning. So that here, we have the cell converted
    full a 6th part of the whole compass, from its true and original
    situation, and so in all the schemes of Mr. <i>Webb’s</i> book, not one
    excepted. In that, for instance, <i>Scheme</i> I, p. 56, the high altar is
    plac’d at D not against a <i>trilithon</i>, as it ought to be, opposite
    to the grand entrance in the front of the temple, and to the (only)
    entrance below, into the <i>area</i>, but against an angle between two. If
    then you suppose that hexagon remov’d back a 6th part, so as that a
    <i>trilithon</i> be set behind the high altar, as it is really in the thing
    its self, and upon the principal diameter of the whole work: then this
    absurd consequence follows, that the opposite <i>trilithon</i> of the cell
    stands in the very midst of the entrance into the cell, upon the same
    principal ground-line or diameter of the work, and quite obstructs the
    view and entrance into it. It is altogether as ridiculous, as if a dead
    wall was built under St. <i>Paul’s</i> organ-loft, which is and ought to be
    the chief entrance into the choir. Besides, by <i>Webb’s</i> ground-plots
    and uprights, it seems as if, when you entered this <i>adytum</i>, there
    were 3 <i>trilithons</i> on the right, and 3 on the left, whereas it is most
    obvious, there are but two on the right, and two on the left; when you
    advance into it, the orderly way, from the north-east grand entrance
    of the avenue; which he himself p. 55. owns to be the principal. But
    I am tired of so ungrateful a talk, which necessity alone could have
    extorted from me.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">DIsputations become cloisters and porticoe’s. Let us now with minds
    free from passion, enter the <i>adytum</i> with an intent to find out its
    true figure, to examine what it really was, and what it is. And that
    may easily be done, because (as I said before) as to the <i>trilithons</i>
    of which it is chiefly compos’d, they are all remaining. Not a bit is
    lost, but what mischievous and silly people knock off with hammers, to
    see whether, as the wretched vulgar notion would have it, the stones
    be factitious. <a href="#tab_XVIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XVIII.</span></a> is a design of it, which I made
    sitting in the center of the grand entrance in the inner circle. This
    point is properly the door-way or entrance into the <i>adytum</i>, as a
    wicket or little door, whilst the jambs of the hithermost <i>trilithons</i>
    present themselves, as the greater door, of above 40 feet wide, 25
    cubits. I observe in the old <i>Greek</i> story, many footsteps of the
    primitive patriarchal way left in their sacred structures, which
    are parallels to this work before us, and others of our Druids. For
    instance, <i>Pausanias in atticis</i> speaks of a temple dedicate to
    <i>Venus</i>, in the front of which, is a wall (as he calls it) built of
    rude stones. Nevertheless he concludes it to be a very famous work. One
    may very well imagine, this wall of rude stones is the remnant of some
    such old work as ours, left for the sacred regard the people had to it,
    even after art was risen to great height, together with superstition
    and idolatry. For that the most ancient <i>Greeks</i> had very little of
    idolatry, any more than our Druids, I shall show when I discourse on
    that head. Again: the more sacred part of the temple at <i>Hierapolis</i>
    answering to our <i>Adytum</i>, had no door, tho’ none enter’d therein but
    the chief priests. <i>Lucian de deâ Syria.</i> I suppose it was in imitation
    of the ancient usage, without doors to shut or open, as our temple
    here. For the ancients thought it wrong, to confine the deity, as it
    were, within any cover’d place: ’till <i>Moses</i>, by God’s direction, made
    a tabernacle cover’d with skins, which was to adumbrate the Messiah
    Son of God, who was to be cloathed with out nature. And <i>Solomon</i>’s
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>temple was built in imitation of this tabernacle. But before that,
    the ancients meant no more by temples, or altars, as they were first
    call’d, than a certain known and conspicuous place, ornamented in a
    particular manner, that should mark out a <i>kebla</i>, or a place towards
    which we are to address the Deity, and that for uniformity sake. As the
    <i>Turks</i> and <i>Arabians</i> do now, who are the descendants of <i>Ishmael</i>,
    and had this custom from <i>Abraham</i>. Tho’ the supreme Being be
    omnipresent, yet for our convenience, where time, place, and such kind
    of circumstances are necessary to a public action, he would have, as
    it were, the place of his presence made notorious. As in the <i>Jewish</i>
    dispensation he did in a most extraordinary manner, by the <i>shechinah</i>.
    And from <i>Solomon</i>’s temple, all the rest of the world borrow’d the
    fashion of temples, properly so call’d, built magnificently and with
    roofs. For the sacred houses mention’d in scripture before then,
    were only little chapels, shrines, like our Druids <i>kistvaens</i>,
    which sometime they carried about in a cart, sometime were fix’d in
    cities, for publick use; as <i>Beth Dagon</i>, and the like. These were but
    <i>kistvaens</i> improv’d, niches turn’d into <i>sacella</i>, in imitation of
    two or three stones in <i>Abraham</i>’s altars, which we may well call the
    <i>kebla</i>, and find many of them among our Druid antiquities.</p>

  <p>The cell is form’d by a radius of 12 cubits and a half, from the two
    centers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, as to the inward curve; the outward takes a radius
    of 15 cubits; for these stones are two cubits and a half thick. The two
    circles are turn’d into an oval, by a radius of 30 cubits, (after the
    usual manner) set in the two centers <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, where the two circles
    intersect. The former centers are 12 cubits and a half distant from
    each other, the length of the radius. The same oval is obtain’d by a
    string of 60 cubits, the ends ty’d together, and turn’d round upon two
    centers, according to the gardiners method. An oval form’d as this is,
    upon two centers coinciding with each other’s circumference; or, which
    is the same thing, whose centers are distant from each other the length
    of their radius, is most natural and most beautiful, being the shape
    of an egg. Most probably these religious philosophers had a meaning,
    in thus including an egg-like figure, within a circle, more than mere
    affectation of variety. Whatever that was, we may reasonably conclude,
    that from the method in antiquity, of making the <i>kebla</i> of a curved
    figure, the christians borrowed theirs of turning the east end of their
    churches in that manner; and that the Druids in the work before us,
    have produc’d the noblest <i>kistvaen</i> or <i>kebla</i> that is known.</p>

  <p>My purpose in drawing many prickt lines upon the plate, is not
    difficult to be understood. Nor does it require particular
    explanations. To avoid affectation or tediousness, I leave them to
    the readers amusement: only observe, that Mr. <i>Webb’s</i> equilateral
    triangles have no hand in forming the cell. The intent of it is
    very distant from a regular polygon. But that it is incomparably
    more beautiful; than such a one would have render’d it. It is as a
    magnificent niche 27 cubits long, and as much broad, measuring in the
    widest place.</p>

  <p>This part is call’d <span lang="el">Σηκος</span> or <i>concha templi</i> and <i>adytum</i>, into which,
    we may suppose, none but the upper order of priests, together with the
    high-priest, were commonly to enter, during the time of ministration,
    in religious rites. We may imagine the beauty of the appearance here
    upon those occasions, when an innumerable company of the Druids
    assisted, all in white surplices. The center of the excentricity of
    this oval is but three cubits nearer the entrance, than the center of
    the whole work. And they have cut off but one <i>trilithon</i>, which they
    make the opening of the <i>adytum</i>; meeting the eye to great advantage,
    from the grand entrance. By the aforesaid contrivance, there is left a
    space of five cubits between the jambs of the opening of the <i>adytum</i>,
    and the inner circle in front, just the same as is between the inner
    and outer circle. The inner circle there performing the office of
    <i>cancelli</i> to it, as we observ’d before. If a choir of this form was
    put in practice, and executed by a masterly hand, it would have a very
    extraordinary effect, and perhaps excel the too similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> concave of
    a cupola. Our Druids had undoubtedly such a notion, in placing this
    within a circle. And for the sake of this, they turn’d the two circles
    into a smaller species of an ellipsis.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Prospect of</i> <span class="smcap">Stonehenge</span> <i>from the Southwest</i>.</div>

  <p>There’s a Druid antiquity like our <i>adytum</i> in shape, call’d <i>Eglwys
    Glominog</i>, on the top of <i>Arennig vaur</i> in <i>Lhanykil</i> parish,
    <i>Merionydhshire</i>, but made of a continued wall. The ancients thought
    the world of an egg-like shape, and as the world is the temple of the
    Deity, they judg’d it proper to form their temples, so as to have a
    resemblance thereto. The ancient hieroglyphic of the Deity is a circle,
    and I have reason to believe it more ancient than the flood. <i>Plato</i>,
    who learnt much from the ancestors of our Druids, says in <i>Diogenes
    Laertius</i>, that God is spherical, which he must mean hieroglyphically.
    So our Druids, as well as he, may mean the infinity of nature in the
    Deity, who made the world, by this scheme of <i>Stonehenge</i>; at least
    they understand by the circle, the seat and residence of the Deity, the
    heavens, which include all things.</p>

  <p>It seems to me, that <i>Inigo Jones</i> from this <i>adytum</i> projected the
    plan of the <i>Surgeons</i> theatre in <i>London</i>, a fabric for seeing
    and hearing much admired by all good judges. And which my Lord
    <i>Burlington</i>, out of a spirit truly noble, and a great love for the
    architect’s memory, has lately repair’d, with his own charges and
    excellent skill. I find the <i>Surgeons</i> theatre (or rather amphitheatre)
    is form’d from the same proportion as our <i>adytum</i>, the transverse and
    conjugate diameters being as 4 to 3, <i>viz.</i> 40 foot and 30 foot. And
    this appears to me a strong presumption, that <i>Inigo Jones</i> did not
    make the ground-plot of <i>Stonehenge</i>, publish’d under his name. The
    <i>Surgeons</i> amphitheatre is a good deal less than our cell.</p>

  <p>Such is the noble and easy geometry of the <i>adytum</i> of <i>Stonehenge</i>.
    The stones that compose it, are really stupendous, their height,
    breadths and thickness are enormous, and to see so many of them plac’d
    together, in a nice and critical figure, with exactness; to consider,
    as it were, not a pillar of one stone, but a whole wall, a side, an end
    of a temple of one stone; to view them curiously, creates such a motion
    in the mind, which words can’t express. One very remarkable particular
    in the construction of this <i>adytum</i>, has escaped all observers: which
    is this. As this part is compos’d of <i>trilithons</i> (as I before call
    them) sett two and two on each side, and one right before; they rise in
    height and beauty of the stones, from the lower end of the <i>adytum</i>,
    to the upper end. My meaning is this. The two hithermost <i>trilithons</i>
    corresponding, or those next the grand entrance, on the right hand,
    and on the left are exceeded in height, by the two next in order; and
    those are exceeded by the <i>trilithon</i> behind the altar, in the upper
    end of this choir. So that in laying down the measures of the parts,
    that compose this place, the reader must be content to take my word.
    Mr. <i>Webb’s</i> measures cannot be precise in all of them, seeing he knew
    nothing of this particular; and that his notion of an hexagon, is
    contradicted by it, as well as by fact. “He says p. 60. the stones of
    the greater hexagon seven foot and a half in breadth, three foot nine
    inches thick, and twenty foot high, each stone having one tenon in the
    middle.” His measure of seven foot and a half in breadth, only shews
    the vastness of the stones, it is no precise measure, for the founders
    regarded not any preciseness in their breadth: because two together
    were design’d to make a <i>compages</i>, whereon to set the impost, and this
    I call a <i>trilithon</i>. Each <i>trilithon</i> stands by its self, independant
    of its neighbour, not as the stones and imposts of the outer circle,
    link’d together in a continued <i>corona</i>, by the imposts carried quite
    round. Indeed the breadth of a stone at bottom is seven feet and a
    half, which is 4 cubits and a half. Two stones therefore amount to nine
    cubits, and there is a cubit of interval between them, making in the
    whole ten cubits. But they were not careful of the particulars, only of
    the whole, in one of these <i>compages</i> or <i>trilithons</i>.</p>

  <p>The stones of the cell are made to diminish very much, towards the
    top, most apparently with a design, to take off from their weight,
    and render them what we call top-heavy, in a less degree. Hence the
    interval between the two upright stones of the <i>compages</i> widens so
    much upwards. This must certainly contribute very much, to their
    stability. In assigning 20 foot for their height, Mr. <i>Webb</i> has
    well taken the <i>medium</i>. A very small matter more than 20 feet makes
    exactly 12 cubits of the <i>Hebrews</i>, <i>Egyptians</i> and Druids. The reader
    remembers the proportion I assign’d between the <i>English</i> foot and this
    cubit. 20 inches and ⅘ make a cubit, therefore 20 feet and ⅘ make 12
    cubits. The true case as to the height of the <i>trilithons</i>, is thus
    respectively, and which may be seen in <a href="#tab_XV"><span class="smcap">Tab. XV.</span></a> with the
    harmony and symmetry, in the proportion of the whole. We may observe
    their gradual rising in height, all from the same base, like pillars of
    higher orders and more diameters. But the intelligent reader must needs
    see, that our founders never had sight of <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i> pillars,
    and never pretended to imitate them, or take any one idea from them.
    And of these three different orders or degrees of altitude, in these
    <i>trilithons</i>, one exceeds the other by a cubit. So that their heights
    respectively are 13 cubits, 14 cubits, 15 cubits.</p>

  <p>The imposts of these <i>trilithons</i> are all of the same height. Mr.
    <i>Webb</i> p. 61. “informs us, the architrave lying on the top of the great
    stones of the hexagon and mortaised also into them sixteen foot long, 3
    foot 9 inches broad, 3 foot 4 inches high.” Mr. <i>Webb’s</i> 16 foot long,
    is too scanty, it amounting to 9 cubits and 2 palms, but the intent
    of the founders was to make these imposts equal both in length and
    breadth to the foundation of the upright stones that supports them, I
    mean the two stones at bottom, the sustaining part of the <i>compages</i>,
    which in its whole breadth makes 10 cubits; and 10 cubits long the
    imposts are to be assign’d. Most certainly whoever undertake to measure
    them, whether from those fallen on the ground, or still in their proper
    place, will be apt to fail in giving them just length. Both because 1.
    ’tis observable that these imposts are form’d somewhat broader upwards,
    than in their bottom part; but this may not be taken notice of by every
    one. This was done very judiciously upon an optical principle, which
    it is plain the founders were aware of. For a stone of so considerable
    an elevation, by this means only, presents its whole face in view.
    Therefore they that measure it at bottom will not take its true length.
    2. If they take the dimension, either from a stone still in its proper
    place, or from one fallen down, they will be very liable to shorten the
    measure. For in the first case, the upper edge of these imposts, must
    needs have suffer’d from the weather, in so elevated an exposure, thro’
    the space of 2000 years. It is very apparent they have suffered not a
    little. Large and deep furrows of age are visible all around them. But
    if they measure those fallen, they must well imagine such have doubly
    suffered, from weather, and from the people every day diminishing all
    corners and edges, to carry pieces away with them. So that in this
    case, analogy and symmetry only can supply these defeats. Thus we found
    before, that the breadth of the imposts of the outer circle is equal to
    their ichnographical breadth: so it is here, being 10 cubits. Besides,
    the outer face of these imposts is longer than the inner, as being
    in the larger circle. Therefore ten cubits is to be understood their
    medium measure.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Webb</i> gives it as a general measure, that they are 3 foot 9 inches
    broad. He has before told us, the uprights which support them were 3
    foot 9 thick; take that twice, it makes 7 foot and a half, which he
    assigns for the breadth, of the uprights. This is all just within a
    trifle, and it is not expected that he who was not aware of the cubit,
    by which these works were made, should do it with greater accuracy. The
    truth of the whole is this: <i>Webb</i>’s 7 foot and half is 4 cubits and a
    half, as we said before; the half of it is 3 foot 9, and a very little
    more. But this must be taken for the least breadth of the imposts,
    that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>at the ends. For in the middle they are somewhat broader. Tho’
    the inside faces are strait, yet, as we observ’d, in proper place, of
    the imposts of the outer circle; so here, they are rounded behind:
    their outer circumference answering to the great oval upon which they
    are founded. So likewise their ends are made upon a <i>radius</i> of that
    oval, whence the inner face of the impost is somewhat shorter than the
    outer, and is another reason why their lengths may easily be taken
    somewhat too short. I have drawn the imposts in their true shape in
    the ground-plot. The artifice of the tenons and mortaises of these
    <i>trilithons</i> and their imposts, what conformity they bear to that of
    the outer circle, is exceedingly pretty, every thing being done truly
    geometrical, and as would best answer every purpose, from plain and
    simple principles. In the bottom face of the impost, if divided into
    three squares, the two mortaises are made in the middle of the two
    outermost squares. Draw diagonal lines from corner to corner; where
    they intersect, is the center of the mortaise; which central distance
    from one to the other, is seven cubits of the Druid measure. Each tenon
    is a cubit broad upon its longest diameter, for they are of an oval
    figure. An admirable contrivance, that the imposts should lie firm
    upon the heads of the uprights, and keep the uprights steady in their
    places, to strengthen and adorn. We may remark this pretty device, in
    the management of the tenons and mortaises. Cut an egg across upon its
    shortest diameter or conjugate; one half thereof represents the shape
    of the tenons of the outer circle. Cut it across upon its transverse
    diameter, one half is the shape of the tenons of the <i>adytum</i>. ’Tis
    evident the meaning of it is this. The tenons of the outer circle are
    higher in proportion, than the others, because the imposts are less
    and lower than the others, and on both accounts more liable to be
    disturb’d, either by accident or violence, than the others: therefore
    more caution is us’d for their preservation. This is an instance of
    art, noble and simple withal. Mr. <i>Webb</i> says the imposts are 3 foot 4
    inches high, which is precisely 2 cubits, a sixth part of the height of
    the <i>medium</i> order of <i>trilithons</i>; as the imposts of the outer circle
    are a sixth part of the height of the stones of the outer circle. The
    medium order of <i>trilithons</i> is above 24 foot high, <i>i. e.</i> 14 cubits.
    The lower order is 13 cubits, <i>viz.</i> those next the entrance. The upper
    <i>trilithon</i> behind the altar was 15 cubits. Each rising a cubit higher
    than the other, as we before observ’d.</p>

  <p>I promis’d to show the reader what <i>Stonehenge</i> is, and what it was.
    The latter, I presume, is done in the four prints, <span class="smcap">Tab.</span> <a href="#tab_XII">XII</a>, <a href="#tab_XIIII">XIV</a>,
    <a href="#tab_XV">XV</a>, <a href="#tab_XVI">XVI</a>. being geometric orthographical sections of the whole
    work, all necessary ways, such as architects prepare in design, when
    they set about a building. ’Tis wholly needless to spend many words
    in explaining them. What the work is, of our <i>adytum</i> at present, is
    shown in the subsequent prints, <span class="smcap">Tab.</span> <a href="#tab_XVIII">XVIII</a>, <a href="#tab_XXI">XXI</a>,
    <a href="#tab_XXII">XXII</a>. The <a href="#tab_V">Vth</a>
    corresponds with the <a href="#tab_XII">XIIth</a>. The one shows the front of the temple when
    in perfection, the other as now in ruins. The <a href="#tab_XVI">XVIth</a> may be compar’d
    with <a href="#tab_XIX">XIX</a> and <a href="#tab_XX">XX.</a> all presenting a view from the <i>adytum</i> toward the
    entrance. <a href="#tab_XVIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XVIII.</span></a> is a contrary view, when one standing
    by the entrance, looks toward the <i>adytum</i>. The same is presented in
    <a href="#tab_VII"><i>Plate</i> VII</a>. which I call a peep into the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>. <a href="#tab_XXII">XXII</a>.
    is the same, but a little oblique. This plate shows at present, what
    the <a href="#tab_XIIII">XIVth</a> does in its original. <a href="#tab_XV"><i>Plate</i> XV</a> and <a href="#tab_XXI">XXI</a>. correspond, showing
    the <i>adytum</i> on one side, in its perfect, and in its ruinous state.
    Particularly they explain, what I spoke of, as to the orderly rising of
    the <i>trilithons</i> in height, one above another, from the lower end to
    the upper end of the <i>adytum</i>. <a href="#tab_XXII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XXII.</span></a> illustrates it, by
    exhibiting to view, the other and most perfect side of the <i>adytum</i>.
    ’Tis an oblique prospect of it, from the entrance.</p>

  <p>The quantity of the solid is well adjusted, in proportioning the
    stone-work of this <i>adytum</i>, to the intervals upon the ichnography.
    Each <i>trilithon</i> is 10 cubits, and each interval about 6. The jambs,
    or <i>vacuum</i> of the entry expand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> themselves to 25 cubits, which is
    about 43 feet. From which measure my Lord <i>Pembroke</i> demonstrated the
    falsity of <i>Webb</i>’s hexagonal scheme, when his Lordship first did me
    the honour to discourse about <i>Stonehenge</i>. In Mr. <i>Webb</i>’s designs, we
    find two jambs (taking one <i>trilithon</i> away) expand but little above
    31 feet, by his own scales. Tho’ I don’t pretend, but that some of my
    foregoing measures, may here and there possibly vary a little, upon
    a very strict trial, and where proper judgment is not us’d, because
    the stones in some parts may protuberate, or great parts of them may
    have fallen off; yet 10 foot difference from truth cannot be allow’d
    of. In the <i>Plates</i> <a href="#tab_XIX">XIX</a> and <a href="#tab_XX">XX</a>. observe the inside of that upright
    stone, which makes the northern jamb of the chief entrance of the
    outer circle. A very great piece is fallen off towards the top, which
    discovers its tenon and the mortaise of the impost above it. And in
    the management of such prodigious stones as these are, fix’d in the
    ground, and ramm’d too like posts: ’tis not to be wonder’d at, if by
    chance we find some little variation. Tho’ for my own part, I observ’d
    none; rather wonder’d, how it was possible for them, without lewices
    and the like devices, to set them in their places to such preciseness.
    And the reader, whose mind has receiv’d no prepossession, cannot but
    be abundantly satisfy’d, that the multitude of measures I have given
    from Mr. <i>Webb</i>’s own account, are perfectly agreeable to the scale
    of cubits, deduc’d from works of the <i>Egyptians</i> and others: and that
    in round and full numbers, not trifling fractions. If we collate
    the numbers given, with the <i>Roman</i> scale, the measures appear very
    ridiculous and without design; and that is a sure way of confuting the
    opinion, of its being a <i>Roman</i> work. But as these stones are generally
    rough, and by time must suffer in all dimensions, ’tis not practical to
    take their true measure, without necessary judgment, and relation had
    to symmetry.</p>

  <p>Of these greater stones of the <i>adytum</i>, as I observed before, there
    are none wanting. They are all on the spot, 10 upright stones, 5
    cornishes. The <i>trilithon</i> first on the left hand is entire <i>in situ</i>,
    but vastly decay’d, especially the cornish. There are such deep holes
    corroded, in some places, that daws make their nests in them. The
    next <i>trilithon</i> on the left hand, is entire, compos’d of three most
    beautiful stones. The cornish happen’d to be of a very durable kind
    of <i>English</i> marble, and has not been much impair’d by weather. My
    Lord <i>Winchelsea</i> and myself took a considerable walk on the top of
    it, but it was a frightful situation. The <i>trilithon</i> of the upper end
    of the <i>adytum</i>, was an extraordinary beauty. But alas through the
    indiscretion probably, of some body digging there, between them and the
    altar, the noble impost is dislodg’d from its airy seat, and fallen
    upon the altar, where its huge bulk lies unfractur’d.</p>

  <p>The last <i>trilithon</i>, that on the right hand of the entrance into the
    <i>adytum</i>, has suffer’d much. The outer upright being the jamb of the
    entrance, is still standing, the other upright and impost are both
    fallen forwards into the <i>adytum</i>, and broke each into three pieces. I
    suppose from digging near it. But from one piece of the impost lying
    loose, in the middle, between the jambs of the <i>adytum</i>, Mr. <i>Webb</i> in
    the plan of his ruins of <i>Stonehenge</i> (being his 6th <i>Scheme</i>) forms
    the remains of his imaginary 6th <i>trilithon</i>, supposing it one of the
    stones of the inner or lesser hexagon, as he calls it. Yet if this
    fragment was really a stump of such a stone, as he would have it, still
    it would not create an hexagonal form of the cell, but stand just in
    the middle of the entrance, and block it up in a very absurd, unseemly,
    and incommodious a manner. And nothing can be more certain, than that
    there never was such a thing in being. That stone of the <i>trilithon</i>
    which is standing, has a cavity in it which two or three persons may
    sit in, worn by the weather.</p>

  <p><i>Stonehenge</i> is compos’d of two circles and two ovals, respectively
    concentric. At the distance of two cubits inward from the greater oval,
    describe another lesser oval, on which the stones of the inner oval
    are to stand: 19 stones in number, at about the central distance of
    3 cubits. This lesser oval is to be describ’d by a string and the 2
    centers, as before. Or by 2 circles from a 10 cubit <i>radius</i>, and the
    2 centers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, as of the other before was spoken. Mr. <i>Webb</i>
    says, p. 60, “the stones of the hexagon within, 2 foot 6 inches in
    breadth, one foot and a half thick and 8 foot high, in form pyramidal.”
    His two foot and a half is our cubit and half, for the breadth of these
    stones; being but a third of the breadth of the stones of the greater
    oval. And the interval between stone and stone, the same. Their height
    is likewise unequal, as the <i>trilithons</i>, for they rise in height as
    nearer the upper end of the <i>adytum</i>. Mr. <i>Webb</i>’s 8 foot assign’d, is
    a good <i>medium</i> measure, for it is just 4 cubits and 4 palms, the third
    part of the height of the <i>medium trilithon</i>. From the ruins of those
    left, we may well suppose, the first next the entrance and lowest were
    4 cubits high; the most advanc’d height behind the altar might be five
    cubits, and perhaps more. The stones are somewhat of what Mr. <i>Webb</i>
    calls a pyramidal form, meaning that of an <i>Egyptian</i> obelisk, for they
    taper a little upwards. They are of a much harder sort than the other
    stones, as we spoke before, in the lesser circle. The founders provided
    that their lesser bulk should be compensated in solidity. They were
    brought somewhere from the west. Of these there are only 6 remaining
    upright. The stumps of two are left on the south side by the altar.
    One lies behind the altar, dug up or thrown down, by the fall of that
    upright there. One or two were thrown down probably, by the fall of the
    upright of the first <i>trilithon</i> on the right hand. A stump of another
    remains by the upright there, still standing. Their exact measures
    either as to height, breadth or thickness, cannot well be ascertain’d.
    For they took such as they could find, best suiting their scantlings,
    but the stones were better shap’d and taller, as advancing towards the
    upper end of the cell.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THUS have we finished the work, or principal part of this celebrated
    wonder; properly the temple or sacred structure, as it may be called.
    Tho’ its loftiest crest be compos’d but of one stone, laid upon
    another. “A work, as Mr. <i>Webb</i> says justly, p. 65. built with much
    art, order and proportion.” And it must be own’d, that they who had a
    notion, that it was an unworthy thing, to pretend to confine the deity
    in room and space, could not easily invent a grander design than this,
    for sacred purposes: nor execute it in a more magnificent manner. Here
    space indeed is mark’d out and defin’d: but with utmost freedom and
    openness. Here is a <i>kebla</i> intimating, but not bounding the presence
    of the Deity. Here the variety and harmony of four differing circles
    presents itself continually new, every step we take, with opening and
    closing light and shade. Which way so ever we look, art and nature make
    a composition of their highest gusto, create a pleasing astonishment,
    very apposite to sacred places.</p>

  <p>The great oval consists of 10 uprights, the inner with the altar, of
    20, the great circle of 30, the inner of 40. 10, 20, 30, 40 together,
    make 100 upright stones. 5 imposts of the great oval, 30 of the great
    circle, the 2 stones standing upon the bank of the <i>area</i>, the stone
    lying within the entrance of the <i>area</i>, and that standing without.
    There seems to have been another stone lying upon the ground, by
    the <i>vallum</i> of the court, directly opposite to the entrance of the
    avenue. All added together, make just 140 stones, the number of which
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, a whole temple, is compos’d. Behold the solution of the
    mighty problem, the magical spell is broke, which has so long perplex’d
    the vulgar! they think ’tis an ominous thing to count the true number
    of the stones, and whoever does so, shall certainly die after it. Thus
    the Druids contented themselves to live in huts and caves: whilst they
    employ’d many thousands of men, a whole county, to labour at these
    publick structures, dedicated to the Deity.</p>

  <p>Our altar here is laid toward the upper end of the <i>adytum</i>, at
    present flat on the ground, and squeez’d (as it were) into it, by the
    weight of the ruins upon it. ’Tis a kind of blue coarse marble, such
    as comes from <i>Derbyshire</i>, and laid upon tombs in our churches and
    church-yards. Thus <i>Virgil</i> describes an ancient altar, after the
    <i>Etruscan</i> fashion, and which probably had remain’d from patriarchal
    times.</p>

    breadth is 2 cubits 3 palms, <i>i. e.</i> 1 and a half: and that its first

    living could testify, undoubted reliques of sacrifices, together with
    much charcoal, meaning wood-ashes. Mr. <i>Camden</i> says, mens bones have

    learning and of pure religion) inscrib’d with many letters, but in
    so strange a character, that neither Sir <i>Thomas Elliot</i> a learned
    antiquary, nor Mr. <i>Lilly</i> master of St. <i>Paul</i>’s school, could make
    any thing out of it. Mr. <i>Sammes</i> may be in the right, who judges it
    to have been <i>Punic</i>; I imagine if we call it <i>Irish</i>, we shall not
    err much. No doubt but it was a memorial of the founders, wrote by
    the <i>Druids</i>: and had it been preserv’d till now, would have been an
    invaluable curiosity. To make the reader some amends for such a loss, I
    have given a specimen of supposed Druid writing, out of <i>Lambecius</i>’s
    account of the Emperor’s library at <i>Vienna</i>. ’Tis wrote on a very thin
    plate of gold, with a sharp-pointed instrument. It was in an urn found
    at <i>Vienna</i>, roll’d up in several cases of other metal, together with
    funeral <i>exuviæ</i>. It was thought by the curious, one of those epistles,
    which the <i>Celtic</i> people were wont to send to their friends in the
    other world. So certain a hope of a future state had the <i>Druids</i>
    infus’d into them. The reader may divert himself with endeavouring
    to explain it. The writing upon plates of gold or tin is exceeding
    ancient, as we see in <i>Job</i> xix. 24.</p>

  <p><i>Plutarch</i> in his pamphlet <i>de dæmonio Socratis</i> tells a similar
    story. “About the time of <i>Agesilaus</i>, they found a brazen tablet in
    the sepulchre of <i>Alcmena</i> at <i>Thebes</i>, wrote in characters unknown,
    but seem’d to be <i>Egyptian</i>. <i>Chonuphis</i>, the most learned of the
    <i>Egyptian</i> prophets then, being consulted upon it, confirm’d it, and
    said it was wrote about the time of <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Proteus</i> king in
    <i>Egypt</i>.” <i>Tzetzes</i>, chil. 2. hist. 44. mentions <i>Proteus</i> a king in
    lower <i>Egypt</i> by the sea side, pretends he was son of <i>Neptune</i> and
    <i>Phœnicia</i>, throwing him up thereby to very ancient times, those of the
    first famous navigators, our <i>Hercules</i> and the <i>Phœnicians</i>. He is
    said to have lived in the island afterward call’d <i>Pharos</i>, from the
    watch-tower there erected. Here <i>Homer</i> sings, that <i>Proteus</i> diverts
    himself with his <i>phocæ</i> or sea-calves, most undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> his ships.
    But at that time of day, every thing new and strange was told by the
    <i>Greeks</i> in a mythologic way.</p>

  <p>In the year 1635, as they were plowing by the barrows about <i>Normanton</i>
    ditch, they found a large quantity of excellent pewter, as much as
    they sold at a low price for 5<i>l.</i> says Mr. <i>Aubry</i> in his manuscript
    collections, relating to antiquities of this sort. There are several of
    these ditches, being very small in breadth, which run across the downs.
    I take them for boundaries of hundreds, parishes, <i>&amp;c.</i> Such as the
    reader may observe in my <a href="#tab_XXXI"><i>Plate</i> XXXI.</a> of the barrows in <i>Lake-field</i>.
    I suspect this too was a tablet with an inscription on it, but falling
    into the hands of the countrymen, they could no more discern the
    writing, than interpret it. No doubt but this was some of the old
    <i>British stannum</i>, which the <i>Tyrian Hercules</i>, sirnam’d <i>Melcarthus</i>,
    first brought <i>ex Cassiteride insula</i>, or <i>Britain</i>. Which <i>Hercules</i>
    liv’d in <i>Abraham</i>’s time, or soon after.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Webb</i> tells us, the Duke of <i>Buckingham</i> dug about <i>Stonehenge</i>:
    I fear much to the prejudice of the work. He himself did the like, and
    found what he imagin’d was the cover of a <i>thuribulum</i>. He would have
    done well to have given us a drawing of it. But whatever it was, vases
    of incense, oil, flower, salt, wine and holy water, were used by all
    nations in their religious ceremonies.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Thomas Hayward</i>, late owner of <i>Stonehenge</i>, dug about it, as
    he acquainted Lord <i>Winchelsea</i> and myself. He found heads of oxen
    and other beasts bones, and nothing else. In 1724. when I was there,
    <i>Richard Hayns</i> an old man of <i>Ambresbury</i>, whom I employed to dig
    for me in the barrows, found some little worn-out <i>Roman</i> coins at
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, among the earth rooted up by the rabbets. He sold one of
    them for half a crown, to Mr. <i>Merril</i> of <i>Golden Square</i>, who came
    thither whilst I was at the place. The year before, <i>Hayns</i> was one of
    the workmen employ’d by Lord <i>Carlton</i> to dig clay on <i>Harradon</i> hill,
    east of <i>Ambresbury</i>, where they found many <i>Roman</i> coins, which I saw.
    I suspect he pretended to find those at <i>Stonehenge</i>, only for sake
    of the reward. My friend the late Dr. <i>Harwood</i> of <i>Doctors-Commons</i>
    told me, he was once at <i>Stonehenge</i> with such sort of <i>Roman</i> coins
    in his pockets, and that one of his companions would have persuaded
    him, to throw some of them into the rabbit-holes: but the Doctor was
    more ingenuous. Nevertheless were never so many such coins found in
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, they would prove nothing more, than that the work was
    in being, when the <i>Romans</i> were here; and which we are assured of
    already. I have a brass coin given me by <i>John Collins</i> Esq; collector
    of the excise at <i>Stamford</i>. The heads of <i>Julius</i> and <i>Augustus</i>
    averse: the reverse a crocodile, palm-branch and garland. <span class="smcap">COL.
      NEM.</span> the colony of <i>Nemausus</i> in <i>France</i>. It was found upon
    <i>Salisbury</i> plain; and might be lost there before the <i>Roman</i> conquest
    of <i>Britain</i> under <i>Claudius</i>, by people of <i>France</i> coming hither; or
    in after-ages: no matter which.</p>

  <p><i>July 5 1723.</i> By Lord <i>Pembroke</i>’s direction, I dug on the inside of
    the altar about the middle: 4 foot along the edge of the stone, 6 foot
    forward toward the middle of the <i>adytum</i>. At a foot deep, we came
    to the solid chalk mix’d with flints, which had never been stir’d.
    The altar was exactly a cubit thick, 20 inches and ⅘; but broken in
    two or three pieces by the ponderous masses of the impost, and one
    upright stone of that <i>trilithon</i> which stood at the upper end of the
    <i>adytum</i>, being fallen upon it. Hence appears the commodiousness of
    the foundation for this huge work. They dug holes in the solid chalk,
    which would of itself keep up the stones, as firm as if a wall was
    built round them. And no doubt but they ramm’d up the interstices
    with flints. But I had too much regard to the work, to dig any where
    near the stones. I took up an oxe’s tooth, above ground, without the
    <i>adytum</i> on the right hand of the lowermost <i>trilithon</i>, northward.
    And this is all the account, of what has been found by digging at
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, which I can give.</p>

    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">OF the court round the temple of <i>Stonehenge</i>, somewhat is said
    already, and of the two stones standing within the <i>vallum</i>: and of the
    two cavities remarkable, which have some correspondency therewith. I
    supposed, they were places, where two great vases of water stood, for
    the service of the temple, when they perform’d religious rites here.
    And I endeavour’d to illustrate it by a coin of the city <i>Heliopolis</i>.
    60 cubits is the diameter of <i>Stonehenge</i>, 60 more reaches the inner
    edge of the circular ditch of the court. The ditch originally was near
    30 cubits broad, but thro’ long tract of time, and the infinity of
    coaches, horses, <i>&amp;c.</i> coming every day to see the place, ’tis levell’d
    very much. The intire diameter of the court, reaching to the outward
    verge of the ditch, is 4 times 60 cubits, which is about 410 foot. The
    five outer circles of the ditch are struck with a radius of 80, 90,
    100, 110, 120 cubits.</p>

  <p>Just upon the inner verge of the ditch, at the entrance from the
    avenue, lies a very large stone, at present flat on the ground. Mr.
    <i>Webb</i>, p. 57. pretends to give us the measure of it, confounding it
    with the other two before-mention’d to be within the <i>vallum</i>, to
    which they have no relation, no similarity in proportion. This is to
    favour his notion of three entrances of the <i>area</i>, dependant upon his
    hypothesis of equilateral triangles. He there tells us at the letter F,
    “the parallel stones on the inside of the trench were four foot broad
    and three foot thick but they lie so broken and ruin’d by time, that
    their proportion in height cannot be distinguish’d, much less exactly
    measur’d.” Thus he, but ’tis <i>invita Minervâ</i>; for all three stones,
    in all appearance, are as little alter’d from their first size, as any
    stones in the work. The two stones within the <i>vallum</i> are very small
    stones, and ever were so. The one stands; the other leans a little,
    probably from some idle people digging about it. This stone at the
    entrance is a very great one, near as big as any one of the whole work,
    and seems too as little alter’d from its original form: only thrown
    down perhaps by the like foolish curiosity of digging near it. Instead
    of <i>Webb</i>’s four foot broad, it’s near seven: but to speak in the Druid
    measure, four cubits. It is at present above 20 foot long. If it stood
    originally, and a little leaning, it was one of those stones which
    the <i>Welsh</i> call <i>crwm lechen</i>, or bowing-stones. However, Mr. <i>Webb</i>
    must falsify the truth very much, in making this and the two former
    any thing alike in dimension, situation and use. But he does so, much
    more in the next, which is doubtless a <i>crwm leche</i>, still standing in
    its original posture and place in the avenue. ’Tis of much the like
    dimension as the other, tho’ not so shapely, and stands in like manner
    on the left hand, or south, of the middle line, of the length of the
    avenue. I surmise, the Druids consider’d the propriety of making the
    other a little more shapely than this, because within the <i>area</i>, and
    nearer the sacred fabric. There is the distance of 119 feet between
    them, to speak properly, 80 cubits. This interval Mr. <i>Webb</i> contracts
    to about 43 foot, and supposes there was another stone to answer it on
    the right hand, as also another to answer that on the inside the ditch.
    And he supposes the like of those before-mention’d, both within and
    without the ditch, at his two fancy’d entrances. But of these, there is
    <i>nec vola nec vestigium</i>, and I dare say, never was. This stone has a
    hole in it, which is observable of like stones, set thus near our like
    temples: as we shall see in the progress of this work. The stone is of
    24 foot in circumference, 16 high above ground, 9 broad, 6 thick. The
    use of it I can’t certainly tell; but I am inclin’d to think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> that
    as part of the religious worship in old patriarchal times, consisted
    in a solemn adoration, or three silent bowings: the first bowing
    might be perform’d at this stone, just without the ditch, the second
    perhaps at the next stone, just within the ditch. Then they turn’d by
    that stone to the left hand, as the manner was, in a procession round
    the temple, both the priests and animals for sacrifice. At those two
    stones and water-vases, probably there were some washings, lustrations,
    or sprinklings with holy water, and other ceremonies, which I don’t
    pretend to ascertain. Then upon the entry into the temple, perhaps
    they made the third bow, as in presence of the Deity. After this, in
    the <i>court</i>, we may suppose the priests prepar’d the hecatombs and
    customary sacrifices. If that great stone just within the ditch, always
    lay, as it does now, flat on the ground, and <i>in situ</i>, (which I am not
    unwilling to believe) then, I apprehend, it was a table for dressing
    the victims. <i>Ezekiel</i>, in describing the temple of <i>Jerusalem</i>, speaks
    of such in the entry, xl. 30, 40, 41, 42, 43.</p>

  <p>’Tis just to think, the ancient form of sacrificing here, like that
    of the <i>Romans</i>, <i>Greeks</i> or elder nations, was pretty much the same
    as that among the <i>Jews</i>, and <i>that</i> as in patriarchal times; and in
    short, no other than the original practice of mankind, since the first
    institution of sacrifices, at the fall. Therefore we shall subjoin it
    from <i>Homer</i>’s description, in <i>Iliad</i> I. It quadrates extremely well,
    in all appearance, with the place and temple before us.</p>

      <span class="subhead"><i>Of the Avenue to</i> Stonehenge.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Avenue of <i>Stonehenge</i> was never observ’d by any who have wrote
    of it, tho’ a very elegant part of it, and very apparent. It answers,
    as we have said before now, to the principal line of the whole work,
    the northeast, where abouts the sun rises, when the days are longest.
    <i>Plutarch</i> in the life of <i>Numa</i> says, the ancients observ’d the
    rule of setting their temples, with the front to meet the rising
    sun. <i>Promachidas</i> of <i>Heracleum</i>, and <i>Dionysius Thrax</i> take notice
    of the same thing. And this was done in imitation of the <i>Mosaic</i>
    tabernacle and <i>Solomon</i>’s temple: probably a patriarchal rite. This
    avenue extends itself, somewhat more than 1700 feet, in a strait line,
    down to the bottom of the valley, with a delicate descent. I observe
    the earth of the ditches is thrown inward, and seemingly some turf on
    both sides, thrown upon the avenue: to raise it a little above the
    level of the downs. The two ditches continue perfectly parallel to the
    bottom, 40 cubits asunder. About midway, there is a pretty depressure,
    natural, which diversifies it agreeably. <i>Stonehenge</i>, I said, is not
    on the highest part of the hill. I found, the reason, why the Druids
    set it just where it is; because it is precisely 1000 cubits from the
    bottom to the entrance of the <i>area</i>. When I began my inquiries into
    this noble work, I thought it terminated here, and Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i>
    and myself measur’d it so far with a chain. Another year, I found it
    extended itself much farther. For at the bottom of the valley, it
    divides into two branches. The eastern branch goes a long way hence,
    directly east pointing to an ancient ford of the river <i>Avon</i>, called
    <i>Radfin</i>, and beyond that the visto of it bears directly to <i>Harradon</i>
    hill beyond the river. The western branch, from this termination at
    the bottom of the hill 1000 cubits from the work at <i>Stonehenge</i>, as
    we said, goes off with a similar sweep at first; but then it does
    not throw itself into a strait line immediately, as the former, but
    continues curving along the bottom of the hill, till it meets, what
    I call, the <i>cursus</i>. This likewise is a new unobserv’d curiosity
    belonging to this work, and very much enlarges the idea we ought to
    entertain, of the magnificence and prodigious extent of the thing. The
    temple which we have been hitherto describing, considerable indeed as
    it really is, in itself; yet now appears as a small part of the whole.
    I shall therefore describe all these parts separately, to render them
    more intelligible: and then show their connection, and what relation
    they have, to one another, as well as I can. But it is not easy to
    enter at once, into the exceeding greatness of thought, which these
    people had, who founded it; bringing in all the adjacent country,
    the whole of nature hereabouts, to contribute its part to the work.
    Therefore I shall discourse of it backward and forward; first going
    from <i>Stonehenge</i> to its termination, or more properly its beginning,
    and then return again. Explaining all the way, what is its present
    condition, and what, ’tis reasonable to suppose, was its original, when
    the Druids made their first design. This together with the several
    views I have drawn of it, will give us nearly as good a notion of the
    whole, as we can at this day expect, and perhaps preserve the memory of
    it hereafter, when the traces of this mighty work are obliterated with
    the plough, which it is to be fear’d, will be its fate. That instrument
    gaining ground too much, upon the ancient and innocent pastoritial
    life; hereabouts, and everywhere else in <i>England</i>: and by destructive
    inclosures beggars and depopulates the country.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the valley, and the end of the strait part of
    <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue, 1000 cubits from <i>Stonehenge</i>, as we said, the
    eastern wing of the avenue turns off to the right, with a circular
    sweep, and then in a strait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> line proceeds eastward up the hill.
    It goes just between those two most conspicuous groups of barrows,
    crowning the ridge of that hill eastward of <i>Stonehenge</i>; between it
    and <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp, separated from them both by a deep valley
    on each side. These two groups of barrows are called generally the
    seven king’s graves, each. I call that most northerly, the old seven
    kings graves, for there are really 7, tho’ but 6 most apparent; they
    are all set at greater distance, all broader, flatter, and as it is
    most reasonable to suppose, older than the other. The other are set
    closer together, of a more elegantly turn’d figure, campaniform,
    and in all appearance, much later than the former. Therefore I call
    these, being southward and directly between <i>Stonehenge</i> and the town
    of <i>Ambresbury</i>, the new seven kings barrows. Of the seven old, the
    most northerly one and probably the oldest, is exceeding flat and as
    it were, almost sunk into the earth with age; so that it is scarce
    visible at a distance. The avenue runs up to the top of the hill, just
    between them: and they make as it were wings to it, and I believe were
    design’d as such, when set there. When the avenue first turns off in
    the valley, it is much obscur’d by the wheels of carriages going over
    it, for a great way together: for this is the road to <i>Lavington</i>.
    Nevertheless a curious eye, without difficulty, sees all the traces
    of it sufficiently, till it is got higher up the easy ascent of the
    hill, and out of the common road. Then it is very apparent and consists
    of the two little ditches as before, (when coming directly from
    <i>Stonehenge</i>) exactly parallel, and still 40 cubits asunder. And it is
    made with the same degree of variation, or about 6 degrees southward
    from the true east point. So that it is evident again, the Druids
    intended it should go full east, but their compass by which they set
    it, varied so much at that time, according to my opinion of the matter.
    To perpetuate the mark of it as much as I can: I measured the distance
    of it from the southern ditch thereof, to the ditch of the nearest <i>i. e.</i>
    most northerly of the new 7 kings barrows, and when in the right
    line of those 7 barrows: it is 257 feet. I know not whether there was
    any design in it, but it is exactly 150 cubits. From the northern ditch
    of the avenue here, to the nearest of the old seven kings barrows, is
    350 foot; which is exactly 200 cubits.</p>

  <p>Whilst we are here upon the elevation of this hill, between these two
    groups of barrows, ’tis 2700 feet from the beginning of this wing of
    the avenue at the bottom of the valley, where it commences. It still
    continues in the very same direction eastward, till unfortunately
    broke off by the plow’d ground, 300 feet from hence. This plow’d
    ground continues for a mile together, as far as the river’s side at
    <i>Ambresbury</i>. So that ’tis impossible to trace it any farther. The
    first plow’d field, that southward, is Mr. <i>Hayward</i>’s; the other is of
    a different estate, call’d <i>Countess-farm</i>. And the plowing of these
    two go on at right angles one of another. That piece on the north
    side of the avenue, of the latter tenure, goes along the line of the
    avenue, is long and narrow, and has (as usual with greedy farmers)
    encroach’d upon and swallow’d up so much of the length of the avenue.
    And that amounts to 750 feet more in length, which must certainly
    be added to the avenue. This is all along the eastern declivity of
    the hill we are upon, <i>that</i> of the twice seven kings graves, and
    reaches near the bottom of the valley, between it and the hill whereon
    stands <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp. Now reason and the judgment I have got
    in conversing with works of this kind, tell me, the founders would
    never begin this avenue at the bottom of a valley, but rather on a
    conspicuous height, which is visible from a great distance of country
    round. We must suppose the intent of the avenue was to direct the
    religious procession to the temple; and that at the beginning of it,
    they made fires early in the morning of that day, when they held their
    grand festivals, to give notice to all the adjacent country. Therefore
    when we cross this valley still eastward, with the former direction of
    the compass, and mount that next hill, whereon stands <i>Vespasian</i>’s
    camp: we find exactly such a place as we could wish, and extremely
    suitable to that purpose, For it commands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> a very extensive prospect
    both upwards and downwards of the river, and on the other side of it,
    for many miles; all about that part of the country where it is highly
    reasonable to think the old <i>Britons</i> liv’d, who frequented this
    temple. This eminence is north of <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp, north-west from
    <i>Ambresbury</i> church. Here is a very large scene of the country taken
    in. It has a fine gentle rise for half a mile and more, even quite from
    the ford at <i>Radfin</i>. You see the most delightful river <i>Avon</i> flank’d
    with villages on both sides, from almost as far as new <i>Sarum</i>, and
    then to the head of it, 5 miles off. It was the custom of the Druids
    to give notice, by fires, of the quarterly days of sacrifice. Thus
    the Druids in <i>Ireland</i> before christianity, us’d to kindle a fire
    call’d in their language <i>Tlachdgha</i>, on <i>All saints</i> eve, to perform a
    general sacrifice: as Mr. <i>Llwyd</i> mentions in his <i>Irish</i> dictionary.
    Mr. <i>Toland</i> speaks of others too. I observ’d there has been a bank
    across the bottom of the valley, for the more easy passage of the
    religious ceremony, and this much corroborates my conjecture of the
    avenue reaching hither.</p>

  <p><a href="#tab_XXIIII"><i>Plate</i> XXIV</a>. explains all that I have last said about this avenue, and
    shews its direction to <i>Haradon</i> Hill, on the other side the river.</p>

  <p>I am apt to believe from the conformity I have observ’d in these works,
    that there was a <i>sacellum</i> or little temple here upon this hill,
    where the avenue began. We suppose this might easily be destroy’d when
    they began to plow here, being so near the town. I have found several
    of these kind of large stones, either travelling to <i>Stonehenge</i>, or
    from it. One as big as any at <i>Stonehenge</i>, lies about 3 miles off
    northward, in <i>Durington</i> fields. Another in the water at <i>Milford</i>,
    another at <i>Fighelden</i>; they seem to have been carried back to make
    bridges, mildams or the like, in the river. There is another in the
    <i>London</i> road, east from <i>Ambresbury</i>, about 2 mile from the town.
    Another in the water at <i>Bulford</i>. A stone stands leaning at <i>Preshute</i>
    farm near the church, as big as those at <i>Stonehenge</i>. What confirms me
    in the conjecture that there was a <i>sacellum</i> here originally, is, that
    an innumerable company of barrows on the opposite hill, on the other
    side of the river coming down <i>Haradon</i>, and in the line of the avenue
    seem to regard it; as is usual in these works. For those barrows are
    not in sight of <i>Stonehenge</i> itself, by reason of the interposition of
    the hill whereon stand the double groups of seven king’s graves. And
    even those two groups seem to regard this little temple as well as the
    great one, curving that way. The distance from hence to <i>Stonehenge</i> is
    4000 cubits.</p>

  <p>In order to have a just notion of this avenue, it is necessary to go to
    the neighbouring height of <i>Haradon</i> hill, on the other side the river.
    The largest barrow there, which I call <i>Hara</i>’s and which probably gave
    name to the hill, is in the line of the avenue; the ford of <i>Radfin</i>
    lying between, as we see in the last <i>Plate</i>. I stood upon this hill
    <i>May</i> 11. 1724. during the total eclipse of the sun, of which I gave an
    account in my <i>Itinerarium</i>. Here is a most noble view of the work and
    country about <i>Stonehenge</i>. Whoever is upon the spot cannot fail of a
    great pleasure in it; especially if the sun be low, either after rising
    or before setting. For by that means the barrows, the only ornaments
    of these plains, become very visible, the ground beyond them being
    illuminated by the suns slaunting rays. You see as far as <i>Clay-hill</i>
    beyond <i>Warminster</i> 20 miles off. You see the spot of ground on the
    hill, whereon stands <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp, where I conjecture the
    avenue to <i>Stonehenge</i> began, and where there was a <i>sacellum</i>, as we
    conceive. From hence to that spot a valley leads very commodiously to
    <i>Radfin</i>, where the original ford was.</p>

  <p>This <i>Radfin-farm</i> seems to retain its <i>Celtic</i> name: meaning a ford
    or passage for chariots, the old way of carriage here used. <i>Rhedeg</i>
    <i>currere</i>, <i>rhedegfain</i> <i>cursitare</i>, in <i>Irish reathaim</i>. <i>Fin</i> in the
    old <i>Irish</i>, is white. It regards the chalky road which went up from
    the ford. ’Tis a pretty place, seated in a flexure of the river, which
    from hence seems to bend its arms both ways, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> embrace the beginning
    of the avenue. The place is very warm, shelter’d from all winds, and
    especially from the north. I am persuaded it was originally a seat
    of an Archdruid or Druid. See Mr. <i>Toland</i> discoursing of the Druids
    houses, p. 111. The nuns of <i>Ambresbury</i> too had a chapel there. The
    ford is now quite disus’d, because of the bridge by the town’s end; and
    the road of it is foreclos’d by hedgerows of pastures on both sides the
    lane, leading northwards from <i>Ambresbury</i> to north <i>Wiltshire</i>. This
    road lying between <i>Radfin</i> and the beginning of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue,
    is sweetly adorn’d with <i>viorna</i>. We are supposed now to stand on the
    <i>tumulus</i> of <i>Hara</i>, an old <i>Irish</i> royal name, and possibly the king
    who was coadjutor in founding <i>Stonehenge</i>, who lived, it’s likely, in
    the eastern part of <i>Wiltshire</i>: for which reason they directed the
    avenue this way.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Here are very many barrows upon this side of the hill, all looking
    toward the sacred work. Hence we survey <i>Ambresbury</i>, <i>Vespasian</i>’s
    camp, and <i>Stonehenge</i>, the <i>cursus</i>, and little <i>Ambresbury</i>. Likewise
    a very ancient barrow which answers to that of <i>Vespasian</i>’s camp,
    seeming to be plac’d here with some regularity and regard to the
    <i>sacellum</i> at the beginning of the avenue. This is a long barrow,
    which I suppose the Archdruids who liv’d at <i>Radfin</i>, and perhaps the
    chief person concern’d in projecting the magnificent work. The reader
    must indulge me the liberty of these kind of conjectures; there is
    no evidence positive left in such matters of great antiquity. I have
    some little reason for it, which I shall mention when we speak of the
    barrows. There is this present use, to affix thereby names to things,
    that we may talk more intelligibly about them.</p>

  <p>We are next to advance down <i>Haradon</i>-hill in the same direction,
    nearer <i>Radfin</i>, from whence I drew <a href="#tab_XXV"><i>Plate</i> XXV.</a> This valley leads us
    very gently to the river.</p>

    <p class="noindent">This and the two views in <a href="#tab_XXVI"><i>Plate</i> XXVI.</a> give us a good notion of the
    country on this side. There are seven barrows together, in the road
    from <i>Ambresbury</i> to <i>Radfin</i>, one great one and six little ones, which
    regard the <i>sacellum</i>, but cannot possibly to <i>Stonehenge</i>. This was a
    family burying-place probably of some considerable personage, who liv’d
    at <i>Ambresbury</i>. These plates show us too, the avenue marching up the
    next hill, where the old and new seven kings barrows receive it again,
    as wings to it. This is shown more distinct in the next plate, <a href="#tab_XXVII"><span class="smcap">Tab.

  <p class="noindent">When you are gone a little farther toward <i>Stonehenge</i>, and arriv’d
    at the top of the hill, if you turn back you have the view presented
    to you like that <a href="#tab_XXIIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XXIV.</span></a> beyond A the beginning of the

    union of the two wings of the avenue, at the commencement of the strait
    part of it C. Again, you may observe the nature of the west wing of the
    avenue, going with a continued curve round the bottom of the hill, till
    it enters the <i>Hippodrom</i> or <i>cursus</i>. At a distance you see <i>Yansbury</i>
    camp, thought to be another of <i>Vespasian</i>’s. Next you descend into
    the valley to the union of the wings of the avenue, and ascend the
    agreeable part <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>of it, to the temple. Along here went the sacred pomp.

  <p>I have often admir’d the delicacy of this ascent to the temple. As soon
    as you mount from the bottom, ’tis level for a great way together: and
    the whole length of it is a kind of ridge, for it slopes off both ways
    from it on each side; so that the rain runs off every way. Just about
    half way there is a depressure, as a pause or foot pace, showing one
    half of the avenue ascending, the other descending, both magnificent,
    in the ancient gusto. There was a temple of <i>Jupiter Labradæus</i> near
    <i>Mylasa</i> a city of <i>Caria</i>, much frequented. The way leading thither
    was called sacred, and pav’d 60 furlongs, thro’ which their procession
    went. <i>Philostratus</i> says, you went to the temple of <i>Diana</i> at
    <i>Ephesus</i>, by a stone portico of a <i>stadium</i>. <i>Pausanias in Phocicis</i>
    says, the avenue to the temple of <i>Minerva Cranea</i> near <i>Elatea</i> is
    ascending, but so gently that it is imperceptible. Again in Chap. X.
    we read of a pav’d way, to the oracle at <i>Delphos</i>. But the natural
    pavement of our avenue is much finer. I take notice, that <i>Jupiter
    Labradæus</i> was a statue holding a halbard in his hand, which instrument
    like a <i>securis</i> or amazonian ax, was as a scepter to the <i>Lydian</i>
    kings. And apparently our <i>English</i> halbard is the very word, with
    an asperate way of pronunciation prefix’d, <i>Labrada</i>. So our Druids
    carried about a sharp brass instrument which we often find, call’d a
    celt, (I know not whence) with which they us’d to cut the <i>Misletoe</i>,
    at their great festival in midwinter. I have represented one hanging at
    our Druids girdle, in <a href="#tab_I"><span class="smcap">Tab. I.</span></a> it was to be put into the slit
    at the end of his staff, when used. But of this hereafter. Now with the

  <p>And now we are return’d to the sacred fabric, we will discourse a
    little upon these temples in general, and so conclude this chapter.</p>

  <p>In Macrob. <i>Saturn.</i> I. 18. mention is made of a famous round temple
    in <i>Thrace</i>, where they celebrate most magnificent religious rites.
    It is upon the hill <i>Zilmissus</i>. The temple is open at top. I suppose
    like ours, not a little round hole like as in the <i>Pantheon</i>, nor is it
    a small round <i>sacellum</i> like those little round temples at <i>Rome</i> to
    <i>Romulus</i>, to <i>Vesta</i>, &amp;c. It is not reasonable to think they should
    build a <i>Pantheon</i> in <i>Thrace</i>, nor can I understand it otherwise,
    than that, it was like our <i>Stonehenge</i>, and in truth an ancient
    patriarchal structure of a primitive model. The Deity here worshipp’d
    was call’d <i>Sabazius</i> says he, some make him <i>Jupiter</i>, some the sun,
    some <i>Bacchus</i>. These are the first perversions of the <i>Jehovah</i> of
    the <i>Jews</i>. In my Judgment, the name <i>Sabazius</i> is a corruption of
    the <i>Hebrew</i> name of God צבאות <i>sabaoth</i>, <i>Deus exercituum</i>, a title
    that would well suit the warlike <i>Thracians</i>. In time Idolatry debased
    every thing. When they perform’d the religious rites of <i>Bacchus</i>, they
    cried <i>Evohe</i>, <i>Sabbai</i>, and call’d him <i>Evius</i>, <i>Evan</i>, <i>Sabazius</i>,
    &amp;c. <i>Evohe</i> is a corrupt manner of pronouncing <span lang="he">יהוה</span> <i>Jehovah</i>, and
    this sacred cry is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> truly no other than what frequently occurs in
    holy scripture. <span lang="he">יהוה צבאות</span> <i>Jehovah Sabaoth</i>. He is the king of
    glory, <i>Psalm</i> xxiv. 10. But I have discoursed on this head in my
    <i>Paleographia Sacra</i> N<sup>o</sup> I. which will be continued.</p>

  <p><i>Diodorus Siculus</i> in his Book II. mentions a very eminent temple of a
    round form, among the <i>Hyperboreans</i>, as he calls them, who inhabit an
    island situate in the ocean over-against <i>Gaul</i>, which is not less than
    <i>Sicily</i>. He gives an odd account from thence mix’d with fable, and
    seemingly some reports of <i>Stonehenge</i> itself.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Toland</i> is confident, this hyperborean region is our <i>Schetland</i>
    isles, whence <i>Abaris</i> the Druid and hyperborean philosopher, famous
    in <i>Grecian</i> story. Whilst I am writing this, <i>March</i> 6. 1739–40. we
    had an account read before the <i>Royal Society</i>, much confirming Mr.
    <i>Toland</i>’s notion; speaking of the admirable temperature of the air
    there, not subject to such extremities, such sudden changes, as even in
    <i>Britain</i> itself. There are such temples as ours there.</p>

  <p><i>Arnobius</i> in VI. speaking of the origin of temples, “We don’t, says
    he, make temples to the Gods, as if we design’d to shelter them
    from the rain, the wind, the sun: but that we may therein present
    ourselves before them, and by our prayers, after a sort, speak to them
    as if present.” We may well affirm this of our temple, built after
    the manner of the patriarchal ones, tho’ probably an improvement,
    and somewhat more magnificent. Ours consists of two ovals and two
    circles. Many in our island, which I suppose older than <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    consist of one oval, or niche-like figure made of three stones only,
    (of which our <i>adytum</i> is a more magnificent specimen) and a circle
    of rude stones fix’d in the ground; of which our work, crown’d with
    a circular cornish, is a more magnificent specimen. Sometime I meet
    with a niche without a circle, sometime a circle without a niche.
    We may well say, the circle is analogous to our chapels, churches,
    or cathedrals, according to their different magnitude; the niches
    correspond to our choirs, altars, and more sacred part of the sacred
    building, the more immediate place of the residence of the Deity. They
    are what now the <i>Turks</i> and <i>Arabians</i> call the <i>kebla</i>, deriv’d,
    as we said before, from the patriarchal practice, and particularly
    from the great patriarch <i>Abraham</i>. I doubt not but the altars which
    he and his posterity made, mention’d in scripture, were a stone upon
    the ground before three set in a niche-like figure, and the whole
    inclos’d in a circle of stones. At other times they set only one stone
    for a <i>kebla</i>, as sometime our ancestors did likewise. This practice
    was propagated generally among all ancient nations. Among many it was
    forgotten, or not practised, where they had but little religion at all.
    Among others, after idolatry had prevail’d with them, they thought all
    former manners of worship like their own, and mistook the stones which
    were <i>keblas</i> or places of worship, for the objects of worship. Hence
    <i>Maximus</i> of <i>Tyre</i> says, the <i>Arabians</i> worshipp’d he knew not what,
    for he saw only a great stone. Which, no doubt, was the <i>kebla</i> toward
    which they directed their devotion, as they had learnt from <i>Abraham</i>,
    or the like patriarchal ancestors. So <i>Pausanias</i> in <i>Achaicis</i> says,
    the ancient <i>Greeks</i> worshipp’d unhewn stones instead of statues; more
    particularly among the <i>Pharii</i>, near the statue of <i>Mercury</i>, were 30
    square stones, which they worshipp’d. If our author could not make his
    narration agreeable to common sense, he might well mistake this ancient
    patriarchal temple, somewhat like ours of <i>Stonehenge</i>, for a circle of
    deities: he himself being a stranger to any other than image-worship. I
    shall handle this matter more largely hereafter, and now let us descend
    again from the temple to the <i>cursus</i>. Only I would close this chapter
    with this short reflection. This avenue is proof enough (if there
    needed any) that our work is a temple, not a monument, as some writers
    would have it. But it requires no formal confutation.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ABOUT half a mile north of <i>Stonehenge</i>, across the first valley, is
    the <i>cursus</i> or <i>hippodrom</i>, which I discover’d <i>august</i> 6. 1723. ’Tis
    a noble monument of antiquity: and illustrates very much the preceding
    account of <i>Stonehenge</i>. It was the universal custom, to celebrate
    games, feasts, exercises and sports, at their more publick and solemn
    meetings to sacrifice. Which was done quarterly and anniversarily, at
    certain stated seasons of the year. <i>Macrob. Satur.</i> I. says, “Upon
    holy days dedicated to the gods, there are sacrifices, feasts, games
    and festivals. For a sacred solemnity is, when sacrifices are offer’d
    to the gods, or holy feastings celebrated, or games perform’d to their
    honour, or when holy days are observ’d.” This great work is included
    between two ditches running east and west in a parallel, which are 350
    foot asunder. When I mention 350 foot, I speak in the gross, and as we
    should set it down in an <i>English</i> scale: but if we look into
    <a href="#tab_VI"><i>Plate</i> VI.</a> where I have given a comparative view of our <i>English</i> foot, and
    the most ancient cubit; at first sight we discern, this measure means
    200 of the Druid cubits. This <i>cursus</i> is a little above 10000 foot
    long: that is, it is made of 6000 Druid cubits in length. A most
    noble work, contriv’d to reach from the highest ground of two hills,
    extended the intermediate distance over a gentle valley: so that the
    whole <i>cursus</i> lies conveniently under the eye of the most numerous
    quantity of spectators. To render this more convenient for sight, it
    is projected on the side of rising ground, chiefly looking southward
    toward <i>Stonehenge</i>. A delightful prospect from the temple, when this
    vast plain was crouded with chariots, horsemen and foot, attending
    these solemnities, with innumerable multitudes! This <i>cursus</i>, which is
    two miles long, has two entrances (as it were:) gaps being left in the
    two little ditches. And these gaps, which are opposite to each other,
    in the two ditches, are opposite to the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i>
    avenue.</p>

  <p>I mention’d before, that at the bottom of the strait part of
    <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue, in the valley, the avenue divides itself into
    two parts. One goes directly east toward <i>Radfin</i>, the other goes
    northwestward, and enters our <i>cursus</i> nearly at the same distance west
    from the gaps or entrances before-mention’d: as those gaps are from the
    east end of the <i>hippodrom</i>. These gaps being at a convenient distance
    from that east end, may be thought to be in the nature of distance
    posts. It seems to me, that the turf of the adjacent ground on both
    sides, has been originally taken off, and laid on the whole length of
    this <i>cursus</i>, because it appears somewhat higher in level. Tho’ this
    was an incredible labour, yet a fine design for the purpose of running.
    The earth of the <i>vallum</i> is likewise thrown inward.</p>

  <p>The east end of the <i>cursus</i> is compos’d of a huge body of earth,
    a bank or long barrow, thrown up nearly the whole breadth of the
    <i>cursus</i>. This seems to be the plain of session, for the judges of the
    prizes, and chief of the spectators. The west end of the <i>cursus</i> is
    curv’d into an arch, like the end of the <i>Roman circus’s</i>. And there
    probably the chariots ran round, in order to turn again. And there is
    an obscure barrow or two, round which they return’d, as it were, a
    <i>meta</i>.</p>

  <p>This is the finest piece of ground that can be imagin’d for the purpose
    of a horse-race. The whole is commanded by the eye of a spectator in
    any part. In the middle is a valley, and pretty steep at present: yet
    only so, as that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> <i>British</i> charioteer may have a good opportunity
    of showing that dexterity, spoken of by <i>Cæsar</i>. But the exquisite
    softness of the turf prevents any great damage by a fall. The ground
    of it hereabouts declines somewhat northward. The main part of this
    <i>hippodrom</i> is upon a gentle ridge running east and west. This render’d
    the place cooler.</p>

  <p>On the southern ridge, toward the west end of it, are many considerable
    barrows: but none towards the east end, for that would obstruct the
    view of <i>Stonehenge</i>. There are many barrows but of no considerable
    bulk, on the north-side, upon the extensive ascent, toward the great
    north long barrow. This magnificent work of the <i>cursus</i> is drawn due
    east and west: except a small variation of 4 or 5 degrees southward
    from the east. If we measure along the bank, from the eastern <i>meta</i>,
    at 700 cubits exactly, we come over against the middle line of the
    strait part of the avenue to <i>Stonehenge</i>: 500 cubits further conducts
    us to the gaps or opposite entrances, I before mention’d; which we
    suppose as distance posts. The whole interval between the eastern
    <i>meta</i> and these gaps, is 1200 cubits. At 1000 cubits more, we come to
    the place where the west wing of the avenue enters the southern ditch
    of the <i>cursus</i>. That west wing too, is just 1000 cubits long to its
    union, with the strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue. Likewise the strait
    part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue is just 1000 cubits long, as mention’d in
    its proper place. This west wing begins, in the bottom of that valley,
    which crosses the middle of the <i>cursus</i> and sweeping along by the
    bottom of the hill, in a gentle curve, meets with the lower end of the
    strait part of <i>Stonehenge</i> avenue, where the wing or avenue unites
    to it, with an equal angle. So that the whole work is laid out with
    great judgment and symmetry; and curiously adapted to the ground, which
    was well consider’d, before the plot was mark’d out, by the first
    surveyors. From the bottom of the valley crossing the middle of the
    <i>cursus</i>, to the western <i>meta</i> is 3800 cubits more, making in the
    whole 6000 cubits. The north end of the eastern <i>meta</i> does not extend
    so far as the northern bank of the <i>cursus</i>: I suppose, the reason is,
    that there might be liberty that way, to stop the horses, at the end of
    the course. Therefore they set out, on the south side of the <i>cursus</i>
    and return’d by the north side. I observe the ditch and bank towards
    the eastern end of the <i>cursus</i> much obscur’d, by the trampling of
    men and horses, frequenting the spectacles here: this being the most
    throng’d.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cursus</i> is directly north from <i>Stonehenge</i>: so exactly, that the
    meridian line of <i>Stonehenge</i> passes precisely thro’ the middle of the
    <i>Cursus</i>. And when we stand in the grand entrance of <i>Stonehenge</i> and
    observe the two extremities of the <i>Cursus</i> the eastern and western
    <i>meta</i>, they are each exactly 60 degrees from the meridian line; on
    each hand: making a third part of the circle of the horizon. By which
    we see, the Druids well understood the geometry of a circle, and its
    measure of 360 parts.</p>

  <p>Pausanias <i>in Beotic.</i> says, ‘among the <i>Thebans</i>, by the gate <i>Prætis</i>
    is the <i>Gymnasium</i> of <i>Jolaus</i> and likewise the <i>stadium</i>, which
    is a bank of earth thrown up, such as that at <i>Olympia</i> and of the
    <i>Laurii</i>. In the same place is the heroical monument of <i>Jolaus</i>. A
    little beyond, to the right is the <i>hippodrom</i>, and in it <i>Pindar</i>’s
    monument.’ The same author in <i>Arcad.</i> VIII. writes, ‘that before the
    walls of <i>Mantinea</i>, in a field, was a <i>stadium</i> made for horse-races,
    in honour of <i>Antinous</i>. Not far from it was the temple of <i>Neptunus
    equestris</i> and others.’ So that we see it was the manner of the ancient
    <i>Greeks</i> thus to define their places for sports by banks of earth, and
    that near their temples.</p>

  <p>After the <i>Romans</i> had borrow’d the use of the <i>British</i> chariots for
    travelling and the like, they us’d them too in the <i>Circensian</i> games.
    Thus <i>Sidonius Apollinaris</i> his poem upon it, <i>Lib.</i> XXII.</p>

  <p>Such, we may well imagine, was the scene of this place, in ancient
    days. And as the poet mentions the river <i>Arar</i>, I may take notice, in
    passing, that I have seen, several other places of sports and racings,
    which I take to have belong’d to the ancient <i>Britons</i>. As particularly
    those two great banks call’d <i>Rawdikes</i> in the meadow near <i>Leicester</i>,
    which spectators look on as unaccountable. Another such work, I have
    seen in the meadow by <i>Dorchester</i>, the ancient <i>Roman</i> city and
    episcopal see, in <i>Oxfordshire</i>. Both are by the side of rivers.
    Another upon the river <i>Lowther</i> by <i>Perith</i> in <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>

  <p>These places by rivers, were more agreeable to the <i>Greek</i> taste, as
    in a hotter country. Another like place of sports, was in the chalky
    valley just without the town of <i>Royston</i>, on the south side of it,
    by the <i>London</i> road. The old <i>Roman</i> road there, or <i>Hermen-street</i>
    passes over one corner of the work, as being of later date. I may,
    perhaps, describe these more largely, another time. We read in <i>Homer</i>
    and <i>Virgil</i> that races were celebrated at funerals.</p>

      sight of</i> Stonehenge. <i>They are single burial places. How the body
      is posited. What has been found in digging into these barrows.</i></span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">I COME in the last place to speak of the barrows, observable in great
    numbers, round <i>Stonehenge</i>. We may very readily count fifty at a time,
    in sight, from the place; easily distinguishable: but especially in the
    evening, when the sloping rays of the sun shine on the ground beyond
    them. These barrows are the artificial ornaments of this vast and open
    plain. And it is no small entertainment for a curious person, to remark
    their beauties, their variety in form and magnitude, their situation.
    They are generally of a very elegant <i>campaniform</i> shape, and done
    with great nicety. There is likewise a great variety in their shape,
    and turn, and in their diameters, in their manner of composition. In
    general, they are always upon elevated ground, and in sight of the
    temple of <i>Stonehenge</i>. For they all regard it. This shews, <i>they</i> are
    but superficial inspectors of things, that fancy from hence, great
    battels on the plain; and that these are the tumultuary burials of
    the slain. Quite otherwise; they are assuredly, the single sepulchres
    of kings, and great personages, buried during a considerable space of
    time, and that in peace. There are many groups of them together, and as
    family burial places; the variety in them, seems to indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> some note
    of difference in the persons there interr’d, well known in those ages.
    Probably the priests and laity were someway distinguish’d; as well as
    different orders and stations in them. Most of the barrows have little
    ditches around, extremely well defin’d. In many is a circular ditch 60
    cubits in diameter, with a very small <i>tumulus</i> in the center. 60 or
    even 100 cubits is a very common diameter in the large barrows. Often,
    they are set in rows, and equidistant, so as to produce a regular and
    pretty appearance, and with some particular regard to the parts of the
    temple, the avenues, or the <i>cursus</i>. For instance, where the avenue
    begins at the first elevation, from <i>Radfin</i> ford, advancing towards
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, seven large and flat old barrows are on the right hand of
    the avenue, towards the east end of the <i>cursus</i>, seven large barrows
    of a newer shape, are on the left hand: both these groups before
    spoken of, are plac’d in a similar manner, in regard to the avenue,
    and as wings or openings to it. Upon every range of hills, quite round
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, are successive groups of barrows, for some miles: and
    we may even observe, that great barrow by Lord <i>Pembroke</i>’s park at
    <i>Wilton</i>, which I call the tomb of <i>Carvilius</i>, is set within view of
    <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1722, my late Lord <i>Pembroke</i>, Earl <i>Thomas</i>, who was pleas’d to
    favour my inquiries at this place, open’d a barrow, in order to find
    the position of the body observ’d in these early days. He pitch’d upon
    one of those south of <i>Stonehenge</i>, close upon the road thither from
    <i>Wilton</i>: and on the east side of the road. ’Tis one of the double
    barrows, or where two are inclos’d in one ditch: one of those, which I
    suppose the later kind, and of a fine turn’d bell-fashion. It may be
    seen in <a href="#tab_IX"><i>Plate</i> IX.</a> On the west side, he made a section from the top to
    the bottom, an intire segment, from center to circumference. The manner
    of composition of the barrow was good earth, quite thro’, except a coat
    of chalk of about two foot thickness, covering it quite over, under the
    turf. Hence it appears, that the method of making these barrows was to
    dig up the turf for a great space round, till the barrow was brought
    to its intended bulk. Then with the chalk, dug out of the environing
    ditch, they powder’d it all over. So that for a considerable time,
    these barrows must have look’d white: even for some number of years.
    And the notion of sanctity annex’d to them, forbid people trampling
    on them, till perfectly settled and turf’d over. Hence the neatness
    of their form to this day. At the top or center of this barrow, not
    above three foot under the surface, my Lord found the skeleton of
    the interr’d; perfect, of a reasonable size, the head lying toward
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, or northward.</p>

  <p>The year following, in order to prosecute this inquiry, by my Lord’s
    order, I begun upon a barrow north of <i>Stonehenge</i>, in that group
    south of the <i>cursus</i>. ’Tis one of the double barrows there: and the
    more easterly, and lower of the two: likewise somewhat less. It was
    reasonable to believe, this was the sepulture of a man and his wife:
    and that the lesser was the female: and so it prov’d, at least a
    daughter. We made a large cut on the top from east to west. After the
    turf taken off, we came to the layer of chalk, as before, then fine
    garden mould. About three foot below the surface, a layer of flints,
    humouring the convexity of the barrow. These flints are gather’d from
    the surface of the downs in some places, especially where it has been
    plow’d. This being about a foot thick, rested on a layer of soft mould
    another foot: in which was inclos’d an urn full of bones. This urn was
    of unbak’d clay, of a dark reddish colour: crumbled into pieces. It had
    been rudely wrought with small mouldings round the verge, and other
    circular channels on the outside, with several indentures between,
    made with a pointed tool, as depicted in <a href="#tab_XXXII"><i>Plate</i> XXXII.</a> where I have
    drawn all the sorts of things found in this barrow. The bones had been
    burnt, and crouded all together in a little heap, not so much as a hat
    crown would contain. The collar bone, and one side of the under-jaw
    are grav’d in their true magnitude. It appears to have been a girl of
    about <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>14 years old, by their bulk and the great quantity of female
    ornaments mix’d with the bones, all which we gather’d. Beads of all
    sorts, and in great number, of glass of divers colours, most yellow,
    one black. Many single, many in long pieces notch’d between, so as to
    resemble a string of beads, and these were generally of a blue colour.
    There were many of amber, of all shapes and sizes, flat squares, long
    squares, round, oblong, little and great. Likewise many of earth, of
    different shapes, magnitude and colour, some little and white, many
    large and flattish like a button, others like a pully. But all had
    holes to run a string thro’, either thro’ their diameter, or sides.
    Many of the button sort seem to have been cover’d with metal, there
    being a rim work’d in them, wherein to turn the edge of the covering.
    One of these was cover’d with a thin film of pure gold. These were the
    young lady’s ornaments. And had all undergone the fire: so that what
    would easily consume fell to pieces as soon as handled. Much of the
    amber burnt half thro’. This person was a heroin, for we found the
    head of her javelin in brass. At bottom are two holes for the pins
    that fastned it to the staff. Besides, there was a sharp bodkin, round
    at one end, square at the other, where it went into a handle. I still
    preserve whatever is permanent of these trinkets. But we recompos’d the
    ashes of the illustrious defunct, and cover’d them with earth. Leaving
    visible marks at top, of the barrow having been open’d, to dissuade any
    other from again disturbing them: and this was our practice in all the
    rest.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="tab_XXIII"><img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="700" /></a>
  </div>
  <div class="caption">The Area of STONEHENGE</div>

  <p>Then we op’d the next barrow to it, inclos’d in the same ditch, which
    we suppos’d the husband or father of this lady. At fourteen inches
    deep, the mould being mix’d with chalk, we came to the intire skeleton
    of a man. The skull and all the bones exceedingly rotten and perish’d,
    thro’ length of time. Tho’ this was a barrow of the latest sort, as we
    conjecture. The body lay north and south, the head to the north, as
    that Lord <i>Pembroke</i> open’d.</p>

  <p>Next, I went westward, to a group of barrows whence <i>Stonehenge</i> bears
    east north-east. Here is a large barrow ditch’d about, but of an
    ancient make. On that side next <i>Stonehenge</i> are ten lesser, small,
    and as it were crouded together. South of the great one is another
    barrow, larger than those of the group, but not equalling the first.
    It would seem, that a man and his wife were bury’d in the two larger,
    and that the rest were of their children or dependants. One of the
    small ones, 20 cubits in diameter, I cut thro’, with a pit nine foot
    in diameter, to the surface of the natural chalk, in the center of the
    barrow; where was a little hole cut. A child’s body (as it seems) had
    been burnt here, and cover’d up in that hole: but thro’ the length of
    time consum’d. From three foot deep, we found much wood ashes soft
    and black as ink, some little bits of an urn, and black and red earth
    very rotten. Some small lumps of earth red as vermilion: some flints
    burnt thro’. Toward the bottom a great quantity of ashes and burnt
    bones. From this place I could count 128 barrows in sight. See a vast
    multiplicity of ’em, <a href="#tab_XXXI"><span class="smcap">Tab. XXXI.</span></a></p>

  <p>Going from hence more southerly, there is a circular dish-like cavity
    dug in the chalk, 60 cubits in diameter, like a barrow revers’d. ’Tis
    near a great barrow, the least of the south-western group. ’Tis between
    it, and what I call the bushbarrow, set with thorn-trees, <a href="#tab_XXXII"><span class="smcap">Tab.
    XXXII.</span></a> This cavity is seven feet deep in the middle, extremely
    well turn’d, and out of it, no doubt, the adjacent barrow is dug. The
    use of it seems to have been a place for sacrificing and feasting in
    memory of the dead, as was the ancient custom. ’Tis all overgrown with
    that pretty shrub <i>erica vulgaris</i>, now in flower, and smelling like
    honey. We made a large cross section in its center upon the cardinal
    points; we found nothing but a bit of red earthen pot.</p>

  <p>We dug up one of those I call Druid’s barrows, a small tump inclos’d
    in a large circular ditch. I chose that next to bushbarrow, westward
    of it. <i>Stonehenge</i> bears hence north-east. We made a cross section
    ten foot each way, three foot broad over its center, upon the cardinal
    points. At length we found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> a squarish hole cut into the solid chalk,
    in the center of the <i>tumulus</i>. It was three foot and a half, <i>i. e.</i>
    two cubits long, and near two foot broad, <i>i. e.</i> one cubit: pointing
    to <i>Stonehenge</i> directly. It was a cubit and half deep from the
    surface. This was the <i>domus exilis Plutonia</i> cover’d with artificial
    earth, not above a foot thick from the surface. In this little grave we
    found all the burnt bones of a man, but no signs of an urn. The bank
    of the circular ditch is on the outside, and is 12 cubits broad. The
    ditch is 6 cubits broad (the Druid’s staff) the area is 70 cubits in
    diameter. The whole 100.</p>

  <p>I open’d another of these of like dimensions, next to that Lord
    <i>Pembroke</i> first open’d, south of <i>Stonehenge</i>. We found a burnt body
    in a hole in the chalk, as before. Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i> was with me.</p>

  <p>In some other barrows I open’d, were found large burnt bones of horses
    and dogs, along with human. Also of other animals as seem’d; of fowl,
    hares, boars, deer, goats, or the like. And in a great and very flat
    old fashion’d barrow, west from <i>Stonehenge</i>, among such matters, I
    found bits of red and blue marble, chippings of the stones of the
    temple. So that probably the interr’d was one of the builders. <i>Homer</i>
    tells us of <i>Achilles</i> slaying horses and dogs, at the funeral of his
    friend <i>Patroclus</i>.</p>

  <p>Lord <i>Pembroke</i> told me of a brass sword dug up in a barrow here,
    which was sent to <i>Oxford</i>. In that very old barrow near little
    <i>Ambersbury</i>, was found a very large brass weapon of 20 pounds
    weight, like a pole-ax. Said to be given to col. <i>Wyndham</i>. In the
    great long barrow farthest north from <i>Stonehenge</i>, which I call
    north long barrow, and supposed to be an Archdruid’s, was found one
    of those brass instruments call’d <i>celts</i>, which I hold to belong to
    the Druids, wherewith they cut off the misletoe, as before mention’d.
    Mr. <i>Stallard</i> of <i>Ambersbury</i> gave it to Lord <i>Burlington</i>, now
    in Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i>’s cabinet: 13 inches long. They dug a cell in
    a barrow east of <i>Ambersbury</i>, and it was inhabited for some time.
    There they found all the bones of a horse. This is the sum of what
    is most material, that fell within my observation, relating to the
    barrows about <i>Stonehenge</i>. We find evidently, these ancient nations
    had the custom of burning their dead bodies, probably before the name
    of <i>Rome</i>. So lachrymatories we read of in scripture, ancienter than
    <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i> times, <i>Psalm</i> lvi. 8.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p><a href="#tab_XXXI"><span class="smcap">Tab. XXXI.</span></a> the barrows in <i>Lake-field</i>. This is as a
    church-yard, the burial-place of some town, or large family. I
    mention’d before, that the ditches observable here, are bounds of
    parishes, hundreds or lordships. The countrymen sometime call this
    group, the prophets barrows. Because the <i>French</i> prophets 30 years
    ago, set up a standard on the largest barrow, and preach’d to the
    enthusiastic multitude.</p>

  <p><a href="#tab_XXXIII"><span class="smcap">Tab. XXXIII.</span></a> bush-barrow, a barrow planted by the shepherds.
    ’Tis south of <i>Stonehenge</i>, and commands a pleasant prospect of the

    plain. You see the hills a little on this side <i>Abury</i>, whereon runs
    the <i>Wansdike</i>, the boundary of the <i>Belgic</i> kingdom.</p>

    to the park.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">I Have inform’d the reader, to the best of my skill, what was, and
    what is the state of <i>Stonehenge</i>, both above, and below ground.
    I apprehend, it will be expected, that I should say somewhat,
    concerning the antiquity and time of erecting these works, especially
    of <i>Stonehenge</i>. But what can we say, of a matter so very remote?
    where the oldest memoirs and reports of the oldest nation inhabiting
    the island, can give us no satisfaction about it: but are as far to
    seek, as to the founders of this wonderful work, as we are, at this
    time, and are forced to apply to magic: in order to account for it.
    Notwithstanding, I shall endeavour to satisfy the readers curiosity,
    in this point, as well as I can; by giving him my own opinion about
    it. Not doubting of his candour, in so arduous an attempt: which
    may perhaps be an amusement to him, whether it gains his belief, or
    not. Therefore, I shall recite, in short, what occurs to me, on this
    subject. 1. As to the antiquity of these temples in general. 2. Of the
    time of founding <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  <p>The former will anticipate, in some sort, what I promis’d, in treating
    of the temples of the Druids in general. But I am naturally led to it,
    here, by observing, that the name of the adjacent town of <i>Ambersbury</i>,
    points out a relation to the work of <i>Stonehenge</i>, and to the ancient
    name of it. For as we took notice at first, the present name of
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, is purely <i>Saxon</i>, given by our latest ancestors, by
    a people wholly strangers to the purport of the thing, that had no
    notion, no report of its having once been a sacred place; and signifies
    no more than hanging-stones, or a stone-gallows. The ancient <i>Britons</i>
    call’d it <i>choir-gaur</i>, which the <i>Monks</i> latiniz’d into <i>chorea
    gigantum</i>, the giants dance; a name suited to the marvelous notion
    they had of the structure, or of the reports of magic, concern’d in
    raising it. But I had rather chuse to think <i>choir gaur</i> in <i>Welsh</i>,
    truly means, the great church; the cathedral, in our way of speaking.
    A general title, which the <i>Welsh</i> inhabitants, the remnants of the
    <i>Belgæ</i>, conquer’d by the <i>Romans</i>, gave it; as well knowing the true
    use of it, and even frequenting it in a religious way. Tho’ they had
    driven off the first possessors of it, and the builders: I mean in
    <i>Divitiacus</i> his time, or sooner, before the <i>Roman</i> invasion.</p>

  <p>There is a very plain reason: that <i>Stonehenge</i> was built, before the
    <i>Wansdike</i> was made, and <i>that</i> was the last boundary of the <i>Belgic</i>
    kingdom in <i>Britain</i>. The stones of which <i>Stonehenge</i> is compos’d,
    were fetcht from beyond that boundary, consequently <i>then</i> an enemies
    country. It seems not improbable, that the <i>Wansdike</i> was made, when
    this <i>Belgic</i> kingdom was at its height, and that time we may well
    guess at, from <i>Cæsar</i>. He tells us in <i>Bell. Gall. Lib.</i> II. 4. “the
    <i>Belgæ</i> are of <i>German</i> original. By force of arms, they possess’d
    themselves of the countries, south of the <i>Rhine</i> and towards the
    ocean, driving out the <i>Gauls</i>. They were a very warlike nation, and
    could produce 100000 men in arms. That one of their kings <i>Divitiacus</i>,
    in the memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> of some then living, obtain’d the government, both of
    great part of <i>Gaul</i> and in <i>Britain</i> too.” I believe the <i>Belgæ</i> and
    <i>Sicambri</i>, all one people of <i>German</i> original. Our <i>Welsh</i> call
    themselves <i>Cymri</i>, and from them <i>Cumberland</i> has its name. It is very
    just to think this <i>Wansdike</i> was made in the time of <i>Divitiacus</i>,
    both because of the greatness of the work, suiting so potent a prince,
    and because it is the last boundary: after that time, the <i>Roman</i> power
    swallowing up all divisions.</p>

  <p>I judge, we may reasonably place the time of making the <i>Wansdike</i>,
    about 50 years before <i>Cæsar</i> wrote, we may say <span class="smcap">AUC.</span> 650.
    <i>Divitiacus</i> probably ordered it to be made in person. And it seems
    to have been drawn from the upper end of the <i>Tees</i> river, about
    <i>Whit-church</i>, and <i>Andover</i>, in <i>Hampshire</i>: to the <i>Avon</i> river,
    about <i>Bristol</i>. These two rivers and the <i>Wansdike</i> separated the
    <i>Belgic</i> kingdom from the old <i>Celtic Britons</i>. They by this means,
    were driven from this beautiful country, and from their stately temple
    of <i>Stonehenge</i>, by these powerful invaders. It is remarkable enough,
    that the inhabitants of <i>Somersetshire</i>, the ancient seat of the
    <i>Belgæ</i>, retain still the <i>Belgic</i>, liquidating pronunciation, <i>v</i>
    consonant for <i>f</i>, <i>z</i> for <i>s</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Devizes</i> is a town in the middle of the length of <i>Wansdike</i>, very
    probably erected, among others, to secure this ditch or fortification.
    It seems to have been the capital fort or frontier town, and to have
    its name from the king, as a trophy or monument of his power: built by
    him in person. <i>Anonymus Ravennas</i> may possibly call it <i>Punctuobice</i>,
    but we have no certainty, that his copy retains the word uncorrupt, or
    that he transcribed it right: nor what alteration the <i>Romans</i> made in
    the original word, nor what was made in the later and barbarous times.
    However there seems enough therein, as well as in the present name of
    the town, to countenance our conjecture. The former part of the word
    <i>punctuo</i>, which Mr. <i>Baxter</i> thinks monstrous, may come, perhaps, from
    the <i>German</i> word <i>pooghen</i>, which signifies an arduous work, and might
    regard the castle here, which is said to have been once, the strongest
    in <i>Europe</i>. <i>Neubringensis</i> calls it <i>Divisæ</i>. They tell us legendary
    stories of its being built by an old <i>British</i> king.</p>

  <p><i>Divisus</i> was probably the name of this <i>Belgic</i> Monarch, or <i>Duiguis</i>:
    as <i>Gluiguis</i> king of <i>Demetia</i> in <i>Wales</i> is wrote <i>Glivisus</i> in
    <i>Toland</i>, p. 186. and the termination may have been form’d into
    <i>Latin</i>, from the <i>Celtic</i> word <i>taeog</i> <i>dux</i>. Whence, perhaps, the
    <i>Etruscan Tages</i>, so much boasted of in their antiquities; likewise the
    modern <i>Doge</i> of <i>Venice</i>. So that <i>Divitiacus</i> may well be <i>Divisus
    dux</i>. The name of the <i>Wansdike</i>, I shewed to be purely <i>Celtic</i>, p. 4.</p>

  <p>It is an ancient oriental custom to make these boundary ditches. Thus
    the land belonging to the several tribes of <i>Israel</i> was marked out
    by a ditch, as we read in the accounts of the holy land. Particularly
    the author of <i>le voyage de la terre sainte</i>, printed 1675. <i>Paris</i>,
    p. 57. says, “he travell’d five or six miles along such a ditch going
    from <i>Joppa</i> to <i>Jerusalem</i>, which parted the tribes of <i>Benjamin</i> and
    <i>Judah</i>.” ’Tis recited <i>Joshua</i> xv.</p>

  <p>The monkish writers make much ado about <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i>, a
    christian king of the <i>Britons</i> (in the time of our great ancestor
    <i>Hengist</i>) building <i>Stonehenge</i>, by the help of <i>Merlin Ambrosius</i> the
    magician, in memory of the <i>British</i> nobility slain treacherously by
    <i>Hengist</i>, at <i>Ambresbury</i>. Some say the fact was committed <i>ad pagum
    Ambri</i>, others call it <i>cœnobium Ambrij</i>, others <i>ad montem Ambrij</i>.
    One while they refer the name to <i>Ambrosius</i>, another time to an Abbot
    <i>Ambrius</i>, and this was among our <i>Roman British</i> ancestors, who were
    christians. They add too, that <i>Merlin</i> fetch’d these stones out of
    <i>Ireland</i>, that they had been brought before, out of <i>Africa</i> into
    <i>Ireland</i>: that he set them up here in the same form, by art magic; and
    that the stones were of a medicinal Virtue. These matters we read in
    <i>Girald. Cambrens.</i> de admirand. Hib. c. 18. <i>Higden</i>’s Polychron. v.
    <i>Geoff. Monmouth</i> VIII. <i>Matt. Westminster</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>This calls to my memory, what the above-mention’d Dr. <i>Harwood</i>
    inform’d me, he had heard the great Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i> say,
    that there were such structures as <i>Stonehenge</i>, in <i>Africa</i>, being
    temples dedicate to <i>Saturn</i>. But I need not be tedious in observing,
    how absurd the <i>Monkish</i> reports are; of a christian king erecting
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, as a sepulchral monument for the <i>British</i> nobility,
    massacred in the monastery of <i>Ambresbury</i>. At the same time they say,
    their bodies were buried in the church-yard of the monastery. Nor how
    they confound the names of <i>Ambrosius</i> the king, <i>Ambrius</i> the abbot,
    the town, abby and mountain of <i>Ambry</i>, and perhaps of <i>Merlin</i> too,
    for one of them was call’d <i>Ambrosius</i>. But their affirming, the
    edifice came out of <i>Africa</i> into <i>Spain</i>, thence into <i>Ireland</i>,
    thence into <i>Britain</i>, and of its being erected here in the same form,
    by art magic; and that the stones are of a medicinal virtue: these
    notions lead us to the original truth, of the Druid founders, and that
    <i>Stonehenge</i> had originally, the name of <i>Ambres</i>, and from it the
    adjacent town of <i>Ambresbury</i> had its name.</p>

  <p>To pursue this matter a little further. Between <i>Stonehenge</i> and the
    town, hanging over the river, upon elevated ground is a fine and
    ancient camp, commonly call’d <i>Vespasian</i>’s, and not without much
    probability, attributed to him. We have often had occasion to mention
    it before. That great man, destin’d by providence for executing his
    final vengeance, on the people of the <i>Jews</i>, and thereby accomplishing
    our Saviour’s predictions; by his successes in this place, pav’d a
    road to the imperial dignity. Having conquer’d the isle of <i>Wight</i>, he
    pursued his good fortune, higher up into this country, where he made
    this camp, and another across the heath, call’d <i>Yanesbury</i>; which
    seems to retain the latter part of his name. The camp we are speaking
    of near <i>Ambresbury</i>, is an oblong square, nicely placed upon a flexure
    of the river, which closes one side and one end of it. There is an old
    barrow inclos’d in it, which, doubtless was one of those belonging
    to this plain, and to the temple of <i>Stonehenge</i>, before this camp
    was made. It is pretty to observe, that the road from <i>Stonehenge</i>
    to <i>Ambresbury</i>, runs upon the true <i>via prætoria</i> of the camp. The
    Generals tent or <i>prætorium</i> was in that part south of the road,
    between it and the river, toward little <i>Ambresbury</i>. There is another
    gate of the camp, at the lower end, northward, the <i>porta prætoria
      ordinaria</i>, in the <i>Roman</i> language. Now I apprehend, that <i>Stonehenge</i>
    was originally call’d the <i>Ambres</i>, from thence this camp was call’d
    <i>Ambresburgh</i>, and thence the name of the town underneath.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Camden</i> writes, “that near <i>Pensans</i> in <i>Cornwall</i>, is a very
    remarkable stone, call’d <i>main Ambre</i>, which tho’ it be of a vast
    bigness, yet you may move it with one finger: notwithstanding a
    great number of men cannot remove it from its place. The name is
    interpreted the stone of <i>Ambrosius</i>.” A picture of it in <i>Norden</i>’s
    history of <i>Cornwall</i>, p. 48. I have seen one of these rocking stones,
    as call’d commonly, in <i>Derbyshire</i>. Mr. <i>Toland</i> in his history of
    the Druids, mentions it too, and says there are such in <i>Wales</i> and
    in <i>Ireland</i>. Sir <i>Robert Sibbald</i> mentions them in <i>Scotland</i>, all
    rightly judg’d to have been done by the Druids. Sir <i>Robert</i> speaking
    of the rocking stone near <i>Balvaird</i> (or the <i>Bards</i> town) in <i>Fife</i>:
    “I am inform’d (says he) that this stone was broken by the usurper
    <i>Cromwell</i>’s soldiers. And it was discover’d then, that its motion was
    perform’d, by a yolk extuberant in the middle of the under surface of
    the uppermost stone, which was inserted in a cavity, in the surface of
    the lower stone.” This is the artifice of the stones at <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    but applied here by the Druids for a moveable principle, as there, for
    stability. I call them mortaise and tenon: and before observ’d them
    to be of an egg-like form; which Sir <i>Robert</i> calls a yolk. The <i>Main
    Amber</i> in <i>Cornwall</i> was likewise destroy’d in the civil wars, by one
    of <i>Oliver</i>’s governors. These reformers had a notion of these works
    being superstitious matters. <i>Main Ambre</i> is <i>lapis Ambrosius</i>, or
    <i>petra Ambrosia</i>. And that name leads us to consider the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> <i>petræ
    Ambrosiæ</i>, on the coins of the city of <i>Tyre</i>. A specimen of them, I
    have drawn on the <i>Plate</i> following.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="197" />
  </div>

  <p>These, and many more of the like sort, struck by the city of <i>Tyre</i>, in
    honour of their founder <i>Hercules</i>, may be seen in <i>Vaillant</i>’s second
    Volume of colony coins, <i>pag.</i> 69, 148, 218, 251, 337.</p>

  <p>They represent two great, rough stones, call’d <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i>,
    with an altar before them, and an olive tree; <i>Hercules</i> the hero of
    <i>Tyre</i>, the famous Navigator of antiquity, their founder, sacrificing.
    On some of the coins <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i> wrote in <i>Greek</i>. He is
    represented indeed like the <i>Greek Hercules</i>, but in the latter times
    of the <i>Roman</i> empire, when these coins were struck, they at <i>Tyre</i>
    were as far to seek about the true meaning and origin of their first
    antiquities, as we of ours. And what knowledge they had of them,
    was from legendary reports of the <i>Greeks</i>, who chiefly, among the
    heathens, had the knack of writing. These reports, as we may find in
    <i>Nonnus</i> his <i>Dionysiacs</i>, 40. and 41. acquaint us, that <i>Hercules</i>
    invented shipping, as a latin poet too intimates, <i>Tibullus</i>.</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Prima ratem ventis credere docta Tyrus.</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>They acquaint us that he ordered <i>Tyre</i> to be built, where the <i>petræ
    ambrosiæ</i> stood, which were two moveable rocks, standing by an olive
    tree. He was to sacrifice on them, and they should become fixt and
    stable: rather, the City should be built with happy auspice, and become
    permanent.</p>

  <p>Here are our <i>Main Ambres</i>, made artfully moveable, a kind of altars,
    or pillars, the same as the pillars of <i>Hercules</i> so fam’d, and as
    little understood. They were the original patriarchal altars, for
    libations and sacrifices, and mean, in general, their Altars, whether
    moveable or immoveable: or as we may speak, their temples, which
    imply an altar properly, inclosed with stones and a ditch, or ground
    dedicated and set apart for public celebration of religious rites.
    For the word <i>Ambrosius</i> means in general, consecrated, dedicated to
    religious use.</p>

  <p>Beside the <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i> of <i>Tyre</i>, and our <i>main ambres</i> of
    <i>Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, we meet with another in <i>Hephæstion</i>’s History
    III. 3. “Speaking of <i>Hercules</i>, he mentions the <i>Gygonian</i> stone, as
    he calls it, near the ocean, which may be mov’d with the stalk of an
    <i>asphodel</i>, but can’t be remov’d by any force.” It seems this word
    <i>Gygonius</i> is purely <i>Celtic</i>. For <i>gwingog</i> signifies <i>motitans</i>, the
    rocking stone; and <i>gwgon</i> is what the boys with us call a gig, or
    little top. For these <i>Gygonian</i> stones are of that shape, pyramidal.</p>

  <p>No wonder these matters are well nigh lost, in the mist of extreme
    antiquity, when even the meaning of the word <i>ambrosius</i> was hardly
    known, either to the antients or moderns, till Mr. <i>Baxter</i> discover’d
    it, in his glossary. It signifies oil of roses, <i>rosaceum</i>: the most
    antient kind of perfume. In the 4th <i>Odyssy</i>, v. 445. <i>Edothea</i> a sea

  <p>In <i>Pliny</i> Nat. Hist. XIII. 1. we find the <i>oleum rhodinum</i> most
    antient, common and simple. And this is the true <i>ambrosia</i>, which from
    its very antient use in sacred rites, had almost lost its meaning; and
    was us’d to signify, one while, the food of the gods, another time,
    immortality; again, whatever is divine, or appropriate to the gods.
    But simply, it signifies oil of roses, still from its first use, in
    sacred matters, it imports anointed, in a religious sense; consecrated,
    dedicated. Then <i>main ambres</i>, <i>ambres</i>, <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i>, signify the
    stones anointed with holy oil, consecrated; or in a general sense a
    temple, altar, or place of worship.</p>

  <p>The truth is, it was a patriarchal custom to consecrate their altars,
    pillars, or in a general word temples, by anointing with oil, either
    simple or perfum’d. Rose oil being the oldest, engross’d the general
    name of the action; so that a stone anointed with oil of roses, is a
    <i>main amber</i>, or <i>lapis ambrosius</i>. The same is an altar, or stone
    dedicate to religious use. The plural number, <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i>, import
    a church or temple, in our way of speaking.</p>

  <p>We have an illustrious instance of this practice in the holy
    Scriptures, and the earliest. <i>Gen.</i> xxviii. This is not commonly
    understood by writers. ’Tis the moving and memorable history of young
    <i>Jacob</i>, sent away from his father’s house alone, to take a long
    journey to some unknown relations. He came to a place, call’d afterward
    <i>Bethel</i>, and sleeping with his head on a stone for a pillow, had a
    celestial vision; and a promise from God, of the highest importance
    to him and all mankind. Awaking, he thought the place had been holy
    ground, where, perhaps, his grandfather <i>Abraham</i> had before-time built
    an altar; an house of God, or gate of heaven, as he elegantly names it.
    “Therefore he rose up early in the morning, which was one circumstance
    (in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> patriarchal times) of the work he was going about, and took the
    stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar; and
    poured oil upon the top of it, and called the place <i>Beth-el</i>, <i>i. e.</i>
    the house of God. Then he vowed, that if God would please to prosper
    him in his journey, and bring him back into his own country, he would
    build a temple there, and consecrate to God the tythe of his substance,
    as was the manner in those times.”</p>

  <p>This is in reality a votive, patriarchal temple, altar or house of
    God, which he not only vows to build, but at the same time endows it.
    The stone which <i>Jacob</i> anointed, was not an altar properly, lying on
    the ground whereon to make a libation, but he set it up as a pillar.
    It was one of the upright stones, which the scripture calls pillars,
    as standing of itself; a part of the circle of stones, inclosing the
    altar. And by the act of anointing, <i>Jacob</i> consecrated it, as the
    manner then was, destined it for a sacred purpose, as an earnest of his
    will in good time to fulfil it. And this he did fulfil, <i>chap.</i> xxxv.
    building the celebrated temple of <i>Bethel</i>. Here <i>Jeroboam</i> set up one
    of his golden calves. At last it was destroy’d by <i>Vespasian</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Exod.</i> xxiv. 4. “we have an instance of <i>Moses</i> rising up early in
    the morning and building an altar, and setting up 12 pillars around
    it.” This was before the tabernacle was made, which introduced the
    custom of cover’d temples.</p>

  <p>But so famous was that patriarchal temple of <i>Jacob</i>’s, which he built
    at <i>Bethel</i>; that the heathen called all their temples of that sort,
    when they were perverted to idolatrous purposes, <i>Bæthylia</i>, <i>lapides
    Bætyli</i>, and the like. Which indeed is but another manner of expressing
    <i>lapis Ambrosius</i>, or our <i>Main Ambre</i>. And according to custom, the
    fabulous <i>Greeks</i> having lost the true history of its origin, affix’d
    many strange stories to it; as of <i>Saturn</i> devouring such a stone,
    wrapt up in a skin, instead of his Son <i>Jupiter</i>: which seems to be
    form’d from the memory of praying at these places, in the name of the
    mediatorial deity, as the patriarchs did. And <i>Sanchoniathon</i> tells us,
    the god <i>Ouranus</i> devised <i>Bætylia</i>, or animated stones. He means our
    rocking stones, <i>gygonian</i> stones. I shall show in my discourse on that
    subject, that by <i>Ouranus</i>, he means righteous <i>Noah</i>, who, according
    to patriarchal usage, builded an altar unto <i>Jehovah</i>, <i>Gen.</i> viii. 20.
    meaning one of these patriarchal temples. In time, by the corruption
    of mankind, these places were desecrated to idolatrous purposes; and
    writers pervert the intent of them. So that God Almighty, raising up
    the Mosaic Dispensation, was oblig’d to interdict the very use and
    practice of these open temples, and introduce the cover’d one of the
    tabernacle; by way of opposition to heathenism, as well as with other
    important views.</p>

  <p>We find now the meaning of anointed stones in antiquity, and the
    olive-tree set by the stones on the <i>Tyrian</i> coins. As the very learned
    Author of <i>Archæologia Græca</i> observes, on the affair of consecration,
    “they were more or less sumptuous and expensive, as other parts of
    divine worship, according to the ability of the worshippers.” Young
    <i>Jacob</i> a traveller us’d plain oil, part of his <i>viaticum</i>, others us’d
    perfum’d oil, or <i>ambrosia</i>. That author cites us from <i>Athenæus</i>,
    the method of consecrating <i>Jupiter Ctesias</i>’s statue with a libation
    call’d <i>ambrosia</i>: and others by anointing with oil, prayers and
    libations, <i>Exodus</i> xxx. 22. We have the holy precious ointment made
    under the <i>Jewish</i> dispensation for the like purpose. And we use such,
    for inauguration of our kings, to this day.</p>

  <p>The <i>Tyrian Hercules</i> who built <i>Tyre</i> and set up the <i>petræ Ambrosiæ</i>
    in those coins, (if I mistake not) liv’d as early as the time, of
    <i>Jacob</i>’s anointing the stone at <i>Bethel</i>. The great <i>Bochart</i>, who
    penetrated very deep into the <i>Phœnician</i> learning, looks upon it
    as a clear matter, that in <i>Joshua</i>’s time, the <i>Phœnicians</i> sent
    innumerable colonies, into the mediterranean coasts, and even to the
    ocean. In the preface to his admirable work <i>Canaan</i>, he says, “he has
    a great suspicion, that colonies went abroad this way, before that
    time. Particularly, he asserts, that <i>Hercules</i>, in <i>Eusebius</i> sirnamed
    <i>Desanaus</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>who was famous in <i>Phœnicia</i> before the <i>Exodus</i>, is the
    same, who conquer’d <i>Antæus</i> in <i>Africa</i>: which in <i>Eusebius</i>, is set
    56 years before. He is call’d <i>Hercules primus</i>, and that is 63 years
    before the <i>Exodus</i>, in <i>Eusebius</i>’s chronology.” Again, he judges it
    to be 2000 years distance between the later <i>Roman</i> times and the first
    <i>Hercules</i>. Now from <i>Constantine</i> the great, 2000 years carries us up
    to <i>Jacob</i>’s time. And he proves, from <i>Aristotle de mirabilibus</i>, that
    <i>Hercules</i> built <i>Utica</i> in <i>Africa</i>, at that time; wherein <i>Eusebius</i>
    says he was famous in <i>Phœnicia</i>, and this must be when <i>Hercules</i> was
    old. He having conquer’d <i>Antæus</i> in that country, when he was young.</p>

  <p>But I find in the same <i>Eusebius</i>, <i>Prometheus</i> is set 111 years still
    earlier, before the first mention of <i>Hercules</i>, this is during the
    life of the patriarch <i>Joseph</i>. <i>Prometheus</i> and <i>Atlas</i> were brothers,
    and students in Astronomy, with whom the story of <i>Hercules</i> is always
    conjoin’d. And so high at least, I must place the time of our <i>Tyrian
    Hercules</i>, who is the same as <i>Desanaus</i>. But <i>Marianus</i> transcribing
    <i>Eusebius</i> calls him <i>Dosenaus</i>. And <i>Hesychius</i> says <i>Dorsanes</i> is a
    name of <i>Hercules</i>, with the <i>Indians</i>. But by the <i>Indians</i>, it is
    likely, the <i>Phœnicians</i> and <i>Arabians</i> are meant; for the ancient
    <i>Greeks</i> call all the country to the east of the mediterranean sea,
    <i>India</i>. And then we may in some measure understand the report of
    <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>, who takes it from <i>Timagenes</i>, an old <i>Greek</i>
    Historian, but a <i>Syrian</i> by nation, speaking concerning the peopling
    of <i>Gaul</i>, “that the more ancient <i>Hercules</i> conducted the <i>Dorienses</i>,
    to the countries bordering on the ocean.” Perhaps the <i>Dosareni</i> are
    meant, an <i>Arabian</i> nation, mention’d by <i>Ptolemy</i>. A Deity of the
    <i>Arabians</i> was called <i>Dusaris</i> or <i>Dosaris</i>, mention’d by <i>Step.
    Byzant</i>, <i>Suidas</i> and <i>Tertullian</i>. A difficult word, which <i>Bochart</i>
    cannot trace from the <i>Arabian</i> language; nor is it easy to say, what
    Deity he was. No wonder such matters are obscur’d, thro’ so long
    distance of time. Some think him <i>Bacchus</i>, some <i>Mars</i>, and why not
    <i>Hercules</i>? for after mankind laps’d into idolatry, these three were
    much confounded.</p>

  <p>I find sufficient testimony, of the <i>Tyrian Hercules</i> coming from
    <i>Arabia</i>, about the red sea, or having companions, that were natives
    of that country. For this reason they nam’d an island at the city of
    <i>Gadis</i>, which they built, <i>Erythia</i>, <i>Erythræa</i>; which <i>Pliny</i> IV.
    22. says, was so called from the first possessors, the <i>Tyrians</i>, who
    came from the <i>Erythræan</i> sea: which is the red sea. <i>Solinus</i> says
    the same. That sea had its name from <i>Erythras</i>, as the <i>Greeks</i> and
    the same <i>Pliny</i> write; who is <i>Edom</i> or <i>Esau</i>, brother of <i>Jacob</i>.
    The words are synonymous, signifying red. The reports of <i>Hercules</i>’s
    expedition to that island <i>Erythræa</i> now <i>Cadiz</i>, is famous in all the
    old <i>Greek</i> writers.</p>

  <p>This relation we have given of the <i>Tyrian Hercules</i>, that he lived
    about the time of <i>Abraham</i>, or soon after, according to <i>Eusebius</i>’s
    chronology; that he came from about the red sea, and had companions
    in his travels, that lived thereabouts, is much confirm’d by what
    <i>Josephus</i> writes, from <i>Alexander Polyhistor</i>; who cites it from
    a very antient author, called <i>Cleodemus</i>, sirnam’d <i>Malchus</i>, who
    wrote a history of the <i>Jews</i>, agreeable with the <i>Mosaic</i>. He says,
    <i>Abraham</i> had several Sons by <i>Keturah</i>, he names <i>Apher</i>, <i>Suris</i> and
    <i>Japhra</i>. That <i>Apher</i> and <i>Japhra</i> were auxiliaries to <i>Hercules</i>,
    when he fought in <i>Lybia</i> against <i>Antæus</i>. That from <i>Apher</i> the
    country was nam’d <i>Africa</i>. That <i>Hercules</i> married his daughter, and
    begat of her <i>Dodorus</i>. <i>Josephus</i> in the same <i>chap.</i> of the first
    book of his antiquities, writes, that <i>Abraham</i> had six sons born of
    <i>Keturah</i>: men, heroic and wise. That they and their posterity were
    settled in <i>Troglodytis</i>, in the country of <i>Arabia fœlix</i>, reaching
    to the red sea. He makes <i>Opher</i> or <i>Apher</i> grandson to <i>Abraham</i>, by
    <i>Midian</i> his son. That <i>Apher</i> waged war in <i>Lybia</i> and conquer’d it,
    and plac’d his sons there, who call’d the Country <i>Africa</i> from their
    father. So <i>Schindler</i> in his lexicon, <i>pag.</i> 1361.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

  <p>Making proper allowance for relations of such very antient matters,
    transmitted by historians of different countries, different languages,
    and so often transcribed and translated, before they come down to us;
    here is enough to confirm and explain, what we have before advanc’d:
    both as to time and place, and matter. And we cannot but see what
    relation our <i>Main Ambres</i> and the <i>gygonian</i> stone by the ocean, have
    to the <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i>, which <i>Hercules</i> set up at <i>Tyre</i>: which is
    the drift of my discourse. That very <i>gygonian</i> stone, for ought I see,
    may be our rocking-stone near <i>Pensans</i>, it stands by the sea-side.
    Nor do I see any absurdity, if we judge, that it was erected there,
    by <i>Hercules</i> in person. Near it is that other famous Druid temple
    call’d <i>Biscawoon</i>, consisting of 19 pillars in a circle and a central
    <i>kebla</i>. The entrance is made of 2 somewhat larger stones, than the
    rest: not improbably one of the <i>Herculean</i> labours. It is affirm’d
    by the best authors, that our <i>Tyrian Hercules</i>, the more ancienter
    <i>Hercules</i>, built the city of <i>Gadis</i>, at <i>Cadiz</i> now. And where-ever
    <i>Hercules</i> came, there we read of his pillars. Thus <i>Avienus</i>.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><i>Arrian</i> II. of the life of <i>Alexander</i>, remarks, “that <i>Gadis</i> was
    built by the <i>Phœnicians</i>. There was a temple of <i>Hercules</i>. The
    form, the sacrifices and ceremonies there perform’d, are all after
    the <i>Phœnician</i> manner.” <i>Strabo</i> in his <i>Lib.</i> III. says there were
    two pillars in this temple, dedicate to <i>Hercules</i>; which the learned
    <i>Tristan</i> in his commentaries on medals, p. 384. says, he doubts
    not, but they were <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i>, in imitation of those of the
    same name, in the temple of <i>Hercules</i> of <i>Tyre</i>, which <i>Herodotus</i>
    in <i>Euterpe</i> speaks of. He appears to have been an extraordinary
    genius, and a man of great piety withal. Therefore where-ever he
    came, he made these patriarchal temples, or set up pillars of stone,
    as antiquity called them. Just as the patriarchal family did in the
    land of <i>Canaan</i>. And <i>Hercules</i> seems to me, to have been a great
    man, raised up by providence, to carry the reform’d patriarchal
    religion, to the extremest part of the then known western world.
    Here, I suppose, the religion of <i>Abraham</i> remain’d pure, for many
    ages, under the Druids, till perhaps corrupted by incursions from the
    continent. It is remarkable, that the <i>Romans</i>, who were so catholic,
    (different from those we now absurdly call <i>Roman</i> catholics) as to
    permit all religions, persecuted only that of the Druids, and the
    christian: whence we are naturally led to think, there was a good deal
    of resemblance. Indeed, the Druids are accused of human sacrifices.
    They crucified a man and burnt him on the altar; which seems to be a
    most extravagant act of superstition, deriv’d from some extraordinary
    notices they had of mankind’s redemption: and perhaps from <i>Abraham</i>’s
    example misunderstood. But as to human sacrifices simply considered,
    the <i>Romans</i> themselves and all other nations upon earth at times,
    practis’d them.</p>

  <p>To this <i>Hercules</i>, antiquity affixed very many names, from different
    notions of him, retain’d in different countries; and after idolatry
    took root, he was worshipp’d under those names of consecration,
    according to the old method. For instance, one of his names was
    <i>Palæmon</i>. <i>Palæmon</i>, says <i>Hesychius</i>, is <i>Hercules</i>. The <i>Greeks</i>
    made him a sea Deity, who had been so great a sea-captain. They call
    him <i>Melicerta</i>, which is his <i>Phœnician</i> name <i>Melcartus</i>, king of
    the city. <i>Ovid</i> tells us the story in <i>Met.</i> IV. <i>Nonnus</i> calls him
    <i>Astrochiton</i> starry-robed, from his being made a constellation in
    heaven. In the <i>Gallic</i> picture of him, which <i>Lucian</i> saw, he is
    represented with a sphere in one hand, under the name of <i>Ogmius</i>. Mr.
    <i>Toland</i> in his history of the Druids, shews us the true interpretation
    of that word, from the <i>Irish</i> language; after the learned had in vain
    attempted the explication of it. From thence we infer he brought the
    use of letters hither. <i>Cæsar</i> informs us, the Druids had them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> He is
    called <i>Assis</i>, by the easterns, which signifies the valiant: the same
    as <i>Hæsus</i> of the <i>Germans</i>.</p>

  <p>Beside the patriarchal custom of building these places of worship, and
    consecrating them with oil, we find many other footsteps of that most
    ancient religion, in the history of <i>Hercules</i>. <i>Silius</i> speaking of
    the strange rites used in the <i>Gaditan</i> temple of <i>Hercules</i>, says,
    the priests officiated there barefooted, practis’d chastity, had no
    statues, us’d white linen surplices. And it is a notorious custom
    with the ancient <i>Phœnicians</i>, to pay tithe. Indeed they paid tythe
    to <i>Hercules</i>. Which only imports, that it was a precept and practice
    introduc’d by <i>Hercules</i>. And after they had deified <i>Hercules</i> they
    practis’d it toward him. This was a common method, when idolatry began.
    I shall treat more largely of these affairs; when I discourse expressly
    of the patriarchal religion. Likewise, I shall prove more fully, from
    chronological characters, that this <i>Hercules</i> liv’d at the time,
    we are speaking of, in the <i>canon Mosaicæ chronologiæ</i>. What I now
    recite, concerning these matters, I could not well avoid, as they in my
    apprehension, relate to the name of <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pliny Nat. Hist.</i> VII. 56. gives us a testimony, of our <i>Hercules</i>,
    under the name of <i>Melcartus</i>, (as <i>Bochart</i> rightly corrects it)
    first bringing tin into <i>Greece</i>, from the <i>Cassiterid</i> islands. By
    which the <i>British</i> are meant. The tin of <i>Tyre</i>, which the merchants
    of <i>Greece</i>, came to buy, at the fairs of that city, is mention’d
    <i>Ezekiel</i> xxvii. 12. which, no doubt, came from hence. But it is much
    earlier mention’d, among lead and other metals, when the <i>Midianites</i>
    had it in <i>Moses</i>’s time, <i>Numbers</i> xxxi. 22. the <i>Chaldee</i> and
    <i>Arabic</i> version there, use the word <i>kastira</i>, the <i>Hierosolymitan
    kistara</i>. No wonder the <i>Midianites</i> should then abound with tin: when
    we were told by <i>Josephus</i>, that <i>Apher</i> son of <i>Midian</i>, was one of
    <i>Hercules</i>’s companions. The LXX. in that passage of <i>Numbers</i> call it
    <span lang="el">κασσίτερος</span>. But tin is mention’d earlier still, in <i>Job</i> xix. 24. and
    <i>Job</i> liv’d in this same country, on the borders of <i>Arabia</i>.</p>

  <p>It is very evident from <i>Bochart</i>, that the <i>Phœnicians</i>, had sail’d
    quite round <i>Britain</i>, by what he writes of <i>Thule</i>. How then can we
    doubt but the great island, which they found in the extremest west, was
    <i>Britain</i>? but they kept their gainful navigation hither so secret,
    for many centuries, that even <i>Herodotus</i> the earliest <i>Greek</i> writer
    professes he knows not, whence the tin comes. <i>Britain</i> was the only
    country, where it could come from, in any quantity, as <i>Pliny</i> says.
    But from this great secrecy of the <i>Phœnicians</i>, we have lost the high
    antiquities of <i>Britain</i>, as unknown to the <i>Greeks</i>; the only heathen
    nation that had the address to commit things to writing. Therefore we
    must be content with what small remains of this kind, can be fish’d
    out of the wreck of time, by such conjectural methods, as antiquaries
    cannot avoid insisting on.</p>

  <p>In <i>Devonshire</i> is <i>Hartland</i> point so call’d corruptly, as the
    excellent <i>Camden</i> observes, for <i>Herculis promontorium</i>. And upon the
    <i>Durham</i> sea coast is a town on a promontory call’d <i>Hartlepool</i>. A
    village call’d <i>Hart</i> near it. I take it to have been call’d by the
    <i>Greek</i> traders here <i>Heracleopolis</i>. And hence, probably came that
    fine old altar in <i>Greek</i>, dedicated to the <i>Tyrian Hercules</i>, which
    Mr. <i>Roger Gale</i> and I copied, in <i>Corbridge</i> church-yard.</p>

  <p>From these and many other considerations of this kind, which I shall
    hereafter treat of more largely and professedly: I cannot but join in
    opinion with <i>Franc. Philelphus</i> in his epistles, and <i>Lilius Giraldus</i>
    in his <i>Hercules</i> mention’d by Mr. <i>Camden</i>, in the last quoted
    passage, and with many other writers, that the very ancient <i>Phœnician</i>
    or <i>Tyrian Hercules</i> conducted an eastern colony hither, upon the
    <i>aborigines</i>; with whom came the Druids, the builders of <i>Stonehenge</i>
    and the like works among us. And let this suffice for what I promis’d
    upon the first head of this chapter, <i>viz.</i> to speak of the antiquity
    of these works in general. 2. We are to speak of the time of founding
    <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN my Enquiries into these works of the antient <i>Druids</i> in our island,
    I observed a greater exactness in placing them, with regard to the
    quarters of the heavens, than one would expect, in works seemingly so
    rude; and in so remote an age, to which we must necessarily refer them.
    What more particularly mov’d my attention, was a certain variation from
    cardinal points, which I observed regular and uniform, in the works
    of one place. And that variation was different, in works of another
    place; yet equally regular and uniform in that place. Suppose (for
    instance) the works about <i>Abury</i> in <i>Wiltshire</i> generally vary 9 or
    10 degrees to the left hand, from cardinal points: <i>i. e.</i> westward
    from the north. And the works at <i>Stonehenge</i> generally vary to the
    right hand, from cardinal points, and that to the quantity of 6 or 7
    degrees. The principal diameter or groundline of <i>Stonehenge</i>, leading
    from the entrance, up the middle of the temple, to the high altar,
    (from which line the whole work is form’d) varies about that quantity
    southward of the north east point. The intent of the founders of
    <i>Stonehenge</i>, was to set the entrance full north east, being the point
    where the sun rises, or nearly, at the summer solstice. As well because
    <i>that</i> is the farthest elongation of the great celestial luminary,
    northward; the complement of our earthly felicity, in ripening the
    fruits of the earth: as because <i>then</i> they celebrated one of their
    principal religious meetings or festivals, with sacrifices, publick
    games, and the like. Such was the custom of all the antient nations.
    The <i>Isthmian</i>, <i>Nemæan</i>, <i>Olympian</i>, <i>Pythian</i> games, famous in the
    works of the learned nations: those of <i>Tyre</i> II. <i>Maccabees</i> iv. 18.
    dedicated to their and our founder, the antient <i>Tyrian Hercules</i>, who,
    I suppose, conducted the first <i>Phœnician</i> colony, with our <i>Druids</i>,
    into <i>Britain</i>: these were all held at this time of the year. A custom
    continu’d from patriarchal times.</p>

  <p>This exactness with which the <i>Druids</i> set their works, and the
    uniformity of their variation, make me believe, this variation was not
    the effect of chance or negligence.</p>

  <p>By a superficial reflexion upon it, we should be apt to suspect, it
    was owing to their observing the sun’s rising on the longest day of
    the year, or summer solstice, and setting their line by it. For this
    is supposed to be a method by which they formerly set our Churches:
    marking the sun’s rising at the equinox. But the <i>Druids</i> were too good
    astronomers and mathematicians to need so mean an artifice: nor does
    it correspond to the quantity precisely enough. Besides, this same
    variation appears where it cannot possibly regard the sun’s rising at
    that time.</p>

    parts relating to this temple before taken notice of; beside the
    avenue leading up to the temple from the north east, in a strait
    line; which has the before-mention’d variation all the way. At the
    bottom of the hill, this avenue divides into two wings, each going
    off from the last mention’d part, with a decent sweep; the one to the
    left hand, westward, the other to the right hand, eastward. They go
    off with a like angle, and that angle varies the like quantity. The
    western wing goes to the <i>cursus</i>, before observ’d, the place upon the
    downs, half a mile off <i>Stonehenge</i>, made for races with chariots and
    horses. The right hand wing of the avenue runs directly eastward for
    a mile together, pointing to a place on an angle of the river, called
    <i>Radfin</i>. This part of the avenue, which was intended by the founders,
    to have been drawn precisely east and west, varies about 5 or 6 degrees
    to the south.</p>

  <p>Likewise, that great work of the <i>cursus</i> itself, which stretches its
    length across the downs, from east to west, like a line of latitude
    upon the globe, varies such a like quantity, from true east and west,
    the same way. The meridian line of <i>Stonehenge</i> passes exactly through
    the middle of this <i>cursus</i>.</p>

  <p>Further, at the east end of this <i>cursus</i>, the huge bank of earth,
    above 200 foot long, made across the end of the <i>cursus</i>, as a <i>meta</i>,
    and whereon sat the princes and judges of the prizes: This bank of
    earth is drawn exactly at a right angle with the <i>cursus</i>, consequently
    due north and south, but with the variation before spoken of. These,
    and other like observations here, as well as in other <i>Druid</i> Works,
    appear’d to me no otherwise to be accounted for, but that the <i>Druids</i>
    us’d a magnetical compass, in laying down the works: and that the
    needle vary’d so much, at that time, from the true meridian line.</p>

  <p>I remember I open’d this affair, near 20 Years ago, to Dr. <i>Halley</i>,
    who was of the same sentiment. Nor am I the first who suspected the
    <i>Phœnicians</i> of old were possessed of this great secret, as well as the
    <i>Chinese</i>, from times immemorial. I am not moved to think otherwise by
    what <i>Bochart</i> writes against it. The very name of the magnet <i>lapis
    Heraclius</i> strongly suggests, the <i>Tyrian</i> navigator before-mention’d
    knew it, as is well argued by <i>Fuller</i> in his Miscellanies, IV. 19.
    And many things occur, in the mythology of the antients, wherein (if
    I mistake not) I discern most evident traces of this knowledge of
    the directive power of the magnet. We are not to despise the fables
    of the antients, but to make the best use of them, and search out
    for their latent truths. My predecessor <i>Cumberland</i>, observes in
    <i>Sanchoniathon</i>, p. 325. “that <i>Apollodorus</i> (for instance) hath
    many truths in his mythic history, deriv’d from the tradition of
    <i>Phœnicians</i> and <i>Egyptians</i>, planting <i>Athens</i>.” And the <i>Greeks</i>,
    those happy practitioners in writing, as well as other arts, took the
    unlucky turn of the <i>marvellous</i>, to so exorbitant a degree, as to
    write nothing without it. In <i>Apollodorus</i>, put out by the learned Dr.
    <i>Gale</i>, p. 114. we have an account of the 10th labour of <i>Hercules</i>,
    his conquest of <i>Cadiz</i>, or <i>Gadira</i>, as then call’d, or <i>Erythea</i>.
    We are told, the hero set up the 2 pillars at the Streights mouth, at
    <i>Gibralter</i>, or then <i>Tartessus</i>; which we may reasonably suppose some
    temple made of these rough stones, or some <i>main ambres</i>, like those
    we mention’d before, the <i>petræ ambrosiæ</i> in the <i>Tyrian</i> coins. Then,
    says our author, going on his journey, “the rays of the sun were so
    vehement upon him, that he had the boldness to draw his bow against
    him. The god admiring the intrepidity of the man, gave him a golden cup
    with which he sail’d over the ocean.” <i>Pisander</i> in his IId. book, (in
    <i>Atheneus Deipnos.</i> XI.) writes the same, only that <i>Oceanus</i> lent him
    the cup. <i>Panyasis</i> in his I. of the history of <i>Hercules</i>, says, he
    begg’d it of <i>Nereus</i>, son of <i>Sol</i>, and with it sail’d to <i>Erythea</i>.
    (Macrob. <i>Saturn.</i> XXI. 5.) <i>Theoclytus</i>, in <i>Atheneus</i> aforesaid, in
    his II. <i>de tempest.</i> mentions the same thing. He said it before in
    his <i>Titanomachia</i>. <i>Pherecydes</i>, in his III. of history, quoted both
    in <i>Atheneus</i> and <i>Macrobius</i>, tells a story somewhat like that of
    <i>Apollodorus</i>, but more particular.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> <i>Servius</i> Æn. VII. mentions it,
    but as some of the former, makes the cup of brass, instead of gold.
    <i>Alexander Ephesius</i> the like. All very ancient writers. <i>Lucian</i> says,
    that <i>Hercules</i> sail’d in a sea-conch shell. What can we understand by
    all this, mention’d by so many grave authors, but a compass-box, which
    enabled him to sail the great ocean, and penetrate to our northern
    island, less obnoxious to the suns vehement heat? Add to this, in
    the same place, <i>Apollodorus</i> speaks of his fighting <i>Albion</i> and
    <i>Dercynus</i>, by <i>Mela</i>, called <i>Bergion</i>, Sons of <i>Neptune</i>; which were
    the most antient names of the <i>Britannic</i> Isles, before the name of
    <i>Britain</i>. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, in his IV. book delivers a like account
    of this 10th labour of <i>Hercules</i>, but in a mere historical manner.
    And adds, that when he return’d by <i>Sicily</i>, he dedicated a grove to
    <i>Geryon</i> the hero, where, to his time, the people did religious rites.
    For this affair of sacred groves, we know our <i>Druids</i> were famous.
    He built a temple likewise at <i>Gades</i>. We are not to suppose it a
    cover’d edifice, like what posterity call’d a temple, but an open one,
    according to the mode of those days. Cover’d temples, at that time,
    being a thing unknown in the world. Afterward, a magnificent temple,
    properly, was there built to him. <i>Mela</i> witnesses, that it was our
    <i>Egyptian Hercules</i>, who was there worshipped. For I suppose our
    <i>Egyptian</i> and the <i>Tyrian Hercules</i> to be all one. The same mention’d
    by the name of <i>Assis</i>, in <i>Manethons</i> XVII. <i>Dynasty</i>, in <i>Josephus</i>
    c. App. in <i>Africanus</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>, and <i>Syncellus</i>. <i>Apollonius</i> II.
    14. writes, it was not the <i>Theban</i> but the <i>Egyptian Hercules</i> that
    came to <i>Gades</i>: which is confirm’d by <i>Hecateus</i>. And <i>Herodotus</i>,
    in <i>Euterpe</i> says, <i>Hercules</i> is a very antient deity among the
    <i>Egyptians</i>, not so, among the <i>Greeks</i>. And I suppose this hero lived
    at, or very near the time of the patriarch <i>Abraham</i>.</p>

  <p>These were the times about the beginning of idolatry. And <i>Hercules</i>
    was far from being an idolater himself, though worshipp’d afterwards,
    for his great exploits, and perhaps on this very account of his
    inventing or knowing the use of the compass. This is the <i>Hercules</i>
    kneeling on one knee, a constellation in heaven, taken notice of by
    <i>Dionysius Halycarn.</i> by <i>Tzetzes</i>, <i>Hyginus</i>, <i>Æschylus</i> and others.
    It seems to indicate his piety; for which the astronomers his disciples
    plac’d him in the heavens. He kneels upon the arctic circle, and
    supports the zodiac on his shoulders; tho’ this is not understood by
    the painting on our modern globes. The <i>Phœnicians</i>, his successors
    in the tin trade of <i>Britain</i>, kept the trade and the very name of
    the Island as a great secret; as well as the use of the compass, till
    it was lost with them. But it seems highly probable, because <i>Lucian</i>
    describes <i>Hercules</i> with a sphere in his hand, that he affixed the
    present Asterisms of the zodiac: and his successors, the <i>Phœnicians</i>,
    propagated them.</p>

  <p>’Tis next to our present purpose, to consider that famous oracle of
    <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> in <i>Africa</i>, to be referr’d to the most early times
    of idolatry: render’d illustrious by <i>Alexander</i> the Great taking a
    journey to it. Which gives us the opportunity of knowing somewhat of it.</p>

  <p>All these nations, with <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Africa</i>, were peopled by the
    posterity chiefly of <i>Ham</i>. They were the first that fell into
    idolatry, and worshipped their common progenitor, call’d <i>Amynus</i>, in
    <i>Sanchoniathon</i>. <i>Hecateus</i> says, <i>Amoûn</i>, as the <i>Egyptians</i> write
    it, is the word of those that invoke god, and that they meant somewhat
    very mysterious by it. The history of its origin is this. <i>Bacchus</i>,
    the hero, or demigod, travelling through the sandy desarts of <i>Africa</i>,
    with a great army, was perishing with thirst; he pray’d to his father
    <i>Jupiter</i> for relief, who sent a <i>ram</i> that show’d him a spring, sav’d
    him and his host. Out of gratitude, the hero builds a temple there, to
    the deity who thus <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>aided him under the form of a <i>ram</i>. There is no
    room to doubt, that this is in part copied from the transaction of the
    children of <i>Israel</i>, in the <i>Arabian</i> wilderness. They have added to
    it, a name and notion borrowed from patriarchal tradition, of a divine
    person, symboliz’d by a ram; horned, anointed, which is all one. We
    christians mean <i>Messiah</i>. Innumerable passages in old authors, which
    I might cite, innumerable monuments of antiquity in sculpture, shew,
    that <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> was figur’d as a ram, with a ram’s head, with rams
    horns. They applied the patriarchal notion of the <i>Messiah</i>, to their
    progenitor <i>Ham</i>, in an idolatrous way: and deified him under that
    character. There is a very remarkable passage in <i>Herodotus</i>, which, it
    is worth our while, to transcribe.</p>

  <p>In <i>Euterpe</i> cap. 42. that author tells us, why the <i>Theban Egyptians</i>
    pay so great a regard to the sheep. “<i>Hercules</i> on his importunity
    to <i>Jupiter</i>, that he might have the honour personally to see him,
    at length prevail’d. And the god consented to exhibit himself to his
    view, under this device. <i>viz.</i> <i>Jupiter</i> cut off a ram’s head, put the
    skin over his own head, and thus appear’d to <i>Hercules</i>. Whence the
    <i>Egyptians</i> made the statue of <i>Jupiter</i>, with a ram’s head, and call
    <i>Jupiter Ammôun</i>. Whence they hold sheep for sacred animals, never kill
    them but once a year, upon the festival day of <i>Jupiter</i>, when only one
    ram is sacrificed, and his head put upon the statue of <i>Jupiter</i>; all
    that are there present, beat the ram, and at last he is buried in a
    sacred urn.”</p>

  <p>It is impossible not to see, that this is derived from that history
    recorded, <i>Exodus</i> xxxiii. <i>Moses</i> desires of <i>Jehovah</i> repeatedly,
    that he might see him. He calls it seeing his glory. He is answer’d at
    length. “I will make all my <i>goodness</i> pass before thee, and I will
    proclaim the <i>name</i> of <i>Jehovah</i> before thee. Thou canst not see my
    face, but I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and cover thee with
    my hand, whilst I pass by. Thou shalt see my back parts only.” Here he
    notoriously promises <i>Moses</i>, that he shall see him, in a symbolical
    form. In the next chapter, <i>Jehovah</i> descended in the luminous cloud,
    or <i>Shechinah</i>, and proclaimed the <i>name</i> of <i>Jehovah</i>; recites those
    attributes that relate to his dealings with mankind, in the strongest
    point of light; “his goodness and mercy, and long-suffering, forgiving
    iniquity, transgression and sin: but adds, he will by no means clear
    the guilty, but visit the fathers iniquity upon the children.” Wherein
    our original and fatal transgression is sufficiently intimated, and
    that God’s justice is equal to his mercy; and the necessity of a divine
    redemption by sacrifice, which in scripture language is call’d, “the
    lamb slain from the foundation of the world.”</p>

  <p>All this the most ancient nations had a knowledge of, from patriarchal
    tradition. When they laps’d into idolatry, they applied these good
    notions to their new idolatry, and made statues from the symbolical and
    figurative forms of speech, us’d in true religion. Their sacrificing
    the ram on the festival day of <i>Jupiter</i>, their beating the ram,
    putting his head on the statue of their deity, burying him in a
    sacred urn: all most evidently pointing out the notions they had, in
    the most early times, of the suffering state of the <i>Messiah</i>. And
    such was the origin, in short, of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>. But it appears,
    by what learned authors write, on <i>Curtius</i>’s description of his
    statue, that a magnetical compass box made one considerable part of
    his sacreds. This we read in <i>Hyde</i> Pers. relig. p. 495. in <i>Curtius</i>
    publish’d by <i>Pitiscus</i>, and by <i>Rader</i> the jesuite, and <i>Schottus</i>
    in <i>Ortelius</i>, by <i>Fuller</i>, <i>Herwart</i> and others. “This compass box
    with the statue of the deity, was set in a golden ship (the golden
    cup of <i>Hercules</i>) and carried in procession on the shoulders of the
    priests, accompanied by women singing an hymn in their own language.”
    I doubt not, but the circumstance of carrying this golden ship, on the
    shoulders of the priests, is an imitation of the <i>Mosaic</i> ark in the
    march of the <i>Israelites</i>, thro’ the wilderness, during their forty
    years pilgrimage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> Tho’ they mistook the reason of the thing; the
    <i>Jewish</i> church then being in a military and travelling state. But
    where the camp rested, the ark was reposited, in the <i>adytum</i> of the
    tabernacle: so likewise when in possession of the land of <i>Canaan</i>.
    This is sufficient proof, that the <i>Lybians</i> herein, copied after the
    <i>Israelites</i>, not <i>vice versa</i>, as our moderns are willing to think, in
    these cases.</p>

  <p><i>Curtius</i> tells us, the habit of <i>Ammon</i>’s statue was made of <i>Smaragd</i>
    and other precious stones, wrought in <i>Mosaic</i> work. Which I take
    to be too, in imitation of the pontifical attire, under <i>Moses</i>’s
    administration: particularly of the sacred, oracular pectoral, made
    of <i>Mosaic</i> work, with gems. I apprehend, that beside the statue of
    <i>Ammon</i>, there was a figure of (the upper part at least of) a <i>ram</i>, on
    the compass box: which was the oracle. And it is easy to guess how this
    may be managed for the purpose; even beyond the trick of <i>Januarius</i>’s
    blood, and other <i>Popish</i> devices.</p>

  <p>Hence we may better understand the famous golden fleece, which
    occasioned the <i>Argonautic</i> expedition, one of the earliest and most
    memorable <i>Æra’s</i> of the <i>Grecian</i> history. If we suppose this golden
    fleece to be a compass box, we see the reason why the choice youth
    of <i>Greece</i> set out upon that voyage: which, as all other matters of
    ancient history, among the <i>Greeks</i>, is so unaccountably puft up with
    the leaven of fable. It became navigators to run any hazard for such a
    treasure. If we enquire into its origin, it is thus. <i>Phrixus</i> son of
    <i>Athamas</i> and <i>Nepheles</i> (according to the <i>Greeks</i>) had a ship given
    him by his mother. The ship is call’d in the fable a golden <i>ram</i>, or
    the ram with a golden fleece (the same thing as <i>Hercules</i>’s golden
    cup.) In this, he and his sister <i>Helle</i>, flying the ill-usage of
    their mother-in-law <i>Ino</i>, sail away by sea. <i>Helle</i> affrighted in the
    voyage, falls overboard and gives name to the <i>Hellespont</i>. <i>Phrixus</i>
    continues the voyage, and goes to <i>Æetes</i> king of <i>Colchis</i>, where he
    hangs up his golden <i>ram</i> in the temple, to <i>Jupiter Phyxius</i>, (one
    would be apt to imagine they meant <i>Pyxius</i>, alluding to the box.)
    <i>Jason</i> made his far-fam’d expedition thither afterward, and stole
    it. But the ram was placed in the heavens, among the constellations,
    as a memorial; the first sign in the <i>Zodiac</i>: which shews the high
    antiquity of the story.</p>

  <p>This account manifestly pretends very great antiquity, and some signal
    event. I observe this <i>Ino</i> their mother-in-law, is said to be the
    nurse of <i>Bacchus</i>, and throwing herself with her son <i>Melicerte</i>
    into the sea, became a goddess, under the name of <i>Leucothea</i>. Her
    son became a god, under the name of <i>Palæmon</i>. This <i>Melicerte</i> is
    allowed by all the learned, to be no other than our <i>Melcartus</i>
    above-mention’d. <i>Palæmon</i> is <i>Hercules</i>, says <i>Hesychius</i>. <i>Palæmon</i>
    is his name of deification. <i>Pausanias</i> in the beginning of his
    <i>corinthiaca</i> informs us, this <i>apotheosis</i> of <i>Ino</i> and <i>Melicerta</i>
    was the occasion of founding the famous <i>Isthmian</i> games. <i>Plutarch</i>
    says the same, and <i>Phavorinus</i>. Again, I observe, <i>Phrixus</i> is said to
    be son of <i>Nephele</i> (a cloud) whence call’d <i>nubigena</i> by <i>Columella</i>.
    We must hence expect somewhat very secret and obscure. Further, all
    writers say openly this <i>ram</i> or ship of <i>Phrixus</i> was oracular and
    could speak upon occasion. So all the writers of the <i>Argonautics</i> too
    will have the ship <i>Argos</i> to be loquacious and oracular. <i>Magnes</i>
    another name of the load-stone is often call’d <i>Adamas</i>, which seems
    to be no other than <i>Athamas</i>. <i>Apollodorus</i> makes <i>Magnes</i> the son of
    <i>Æolus</i>, who marrying <i>Nais</i>, inhabited the isle <i>Seriphus</i>. <i>Æolus</i>
    was a great sailor, invented sails, and studied the winds, therefore
    deified and made the god of the winds. I suppose it all ends in the
    mysterious invelopement of the knowledge of the magnetic compass.</p>

  <p>I hope for the readers candour, in reciting thus much from antient
    fable, which I did as concisely as possible. But in matters of obscure
    antiquity, we must make use of all helps. And in heathen antiquity we
    have no other. A strictly historical way of writing in former times, is
    only to be expected in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>sacred canon of the <i>Jews</i>. And what is
    remarkable, after God’s holy spirit had deserted <i>them</i>, their writers
    became the greatest fablers in the world, and, if possible, out-did the
    <i>Greeks</i>, in that way.</p>

  <p>One would imagine, the fashion of these most antient charts, was to
    divide the circle into 12 parts, and affix the celestial signs of the
    zodiac to them; beginning with the east at <i>aries</i>, where the sun
    rises at the equinoxes; and thence they might call the box by the
    name of <i>aries</i>, as shewing the east where <i>aries</i> is plac’d. As now
    the <i>Turks</i> and <i>Arabians</i> call it <i>kibla noma</i>, <i>i. e.</i> shewing the
    <i>kibla</i>, or south point, the way toward which they turn their faces
    in devotion. So we only enquire for the north point; and call it the
    lode-stone, because it shews the lode-star or north pole. But ’tis all
    one; any one point in a circle being found, the rest are found too.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, it seems probable, that the fable of the hero
    finding out the spring in the sandy desarts of <i>Africa</i>, by the help
    of a ram sent from <i>Jupiter</i>, means the travelling over those immense
    plains by the help of a compass, which they call’d by the name of a
    <i>ram</i>, or a golden ram. And that the possessors of the antient oracle
    of <i>Ammon</i> had such a secret, which they cunningly applied to the
    sacreds of their deity. Probably, in that most early age, they had not
    improv’d the use of it to the pitch and manner that we enjoy, with a
    needle; and <i>that</i> set upon a central pin: but having found out the
    veracity of the magnet, they put it into a boat, which was to swim on
    water, and therein it would have liberty to turn itself to its proper
    direction. And this is the sentiment of the learned Dr. <i>Wallis</i>, in
    the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, N<sup>o</sup>. 278. This boat was the better
    a handle for the mythologists to call <i>Hercules</i>’s vessel a golden
    cup, because cups were made in the shape of a boat, and had the same
    denomination, <i>cymbium</i>.</p>

  <p>Those learned commentators upon <i>Curtius</i> abovementioned agree, there
    was a stone along with the statue of <i>Ammon</i>, carried about in the
    golden ship; and perhaps, hence the antient navigators took the hint
    of applying the figure of the ram to their compasses, however form’d,
    and gave it the name of the <i>ram</i>, or golden fleece, which the <i>Greek</i>
    fables, their most antient history, ring of: and hence their ships
    deriv’d their oracular quality. <i>Phrixus</i>’s ship, the golden <i>ram</i>,
    being said to speak on occasion, as well as the ship <i>argos</i>. The
    stupendous properties of this stone, without difficulty, would persuade
    even those above the vulgar, that there was a divine principle in it,
    quite metaphysical, consequently oracular. And in the dawnings of
    idolatry, the evil agent who was vigilant to pervert every thing to
    his own purpose, would not fail to make great use of the secrets of
    the magnet. The intire notion of oracles among the heathen, is caused
    by the devil’s mimickry of God’s transactions among the patriarchs
    and the <i>Jews</i>. But I believe the <i>Egyptians</i> took their notion of
    carrying a boat in all their religious processions, from this magnetic
    boat, of which both <i>Herodotus</i> and <i>Plutarch</i> inform us. For they
    intended it to signify the movement and descent of the divine ideas
    from the supreme mind; especially the very fountain and principal of
    those ideas: and it must be own’d to be admirably well chose. Hence
    the top and the bottom of the verge or <i>limbus</i> of the celebrated
    <i>Isiac</i> tablet, is adorn’d with a boat. In one a ram, in the other
    a bull. Meaning the origin of the chain of ideas flowing from the
    divine mind. ’Tis highly probable, <i>that</i> with the ram is the copy of
    <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>’s boat, mention’d by <i>Curtius</i>. And I suppose this is
    <i>Herwart</i>’s opinion, but I have not yet seen his book. Of this I shall
    discourse larger in my explication of the <i>Bembin</i> table. However
    <i>Herodotus</i> tells us in his II. book, that the temple of <i>Jupiter
      Ammon</i> took its rise from <i>Phœnicia</i>. I only mention this for the sake
    of those that are over acting the credit of antiquities in <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>We learn in <i>Plutarch</i>’s discourse <i>de Isid. &amp; Osir</i>, that the ship
    <i>argos</i> of the <i>Greeks</i>, was in reality the ship that our <i>Hercules</i>
    sail’d round the world in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> Further, this oracular ship has its name
    <i>argos</i>, says my friend Mr. <i>Baxter</i>, <i>gloss. ant. rom.</i> from the
    <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Syrian</i> word <i>argan</i>, an ark. Which confirms what I
    said above, concerning the carrying about the ship of <i>Ammon</i> on the
    shoulders of the priests. <i>Strabo</i> in II. of his geography, mentions
    the temple of <i>Leucothea</i>, built by <i>Phrixus</i> at <i>Colchos</i>; that there
    was an oracle there; and that the sheep was never slain at the place.
    This shews its relation to that of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>. <i>Leucothea</i> is the
    name of consecration of <i>Hercules</i> his mother, <i>Hercules</i> himself being
    call’d <i>Palæmon</i>; both made sea deities: from the extraordinary fame
    of <i>Hercules</i>, the first and great sea captain. <i>Pausanias in Atticis</i>
    says, he was buried in the <i>Corinthian Isthmus</i>; where the <i>Isthmian</i>
    games were kept to his memory. But <i>Mela</i> writes, that his remains
    were at <i>Gades</i>. It’s probable there was only an honorary monument of
    him at the <i>Isthmus</i>, as founder: as the honorary monument of <i>Jolaus</i>
    mention’d to be among the <i>Thebans</i>, by the <i>Stadium</i>, p. 42.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Baxter</i> in <i>gloss. ant. rom. v. ascania</i> makes <i>Phrixus</i> to be
    <i>Aphricus</i>, and the same person as <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>, or the founder
    of the temple of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>; rather, of that prior to <i>Jupiter
    Ammon</i>. We are not to regard the little artifices of the <i>Greeks</i>, who
    draw all celebrated events and persons of antiquity, into their own
    country. <i>Aphricus</i>, no doubt, is the <i>Aphre</i> before-mentioned, son
    of <i>Midian</i>, son of <i>Abraham</i>; whom <i>Cleodemus</i> makes an associate of
    <i>Hercules</i>, in his <i>Lybian</i> wars. <i>Josephus</i> makes him the conqueror
    of <i>Lybia</i>, and that he gave name to <i>Africa</i>. ’Tis not unlikely
    but that he is the hero that travell’d over these barren sands by
    the help of the compass, as his countrymen the <i>Arabians</i> have from
    times immemorial practised, in travelling over their own desarts. And
    might probably erect a patriarchal temple there; and in times of his
    posterity it degenerated into the idolatrous temple of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>.
    And there the compass box of the hero remain’d, and was converted into
    part of the heathen sacreds.</p>

  <p>’Tis no very strange matter, if they at another time call this same
    hero <i>Bacchus</i>, therein confounding him with the like travels of the
    <i>Israelites</i>, through the <i>Arabian</i> desarts. We are not to expert these
    histories of old times involv’d in fable, absolutely consistent. But
    if this account be agreeable to truth or near it; then we may imagine
    the same <i>Aphre</i>, by the <i>Greeks</i> call’d <i>Phrixus</i>, according to Mr.
    <i>Baxter</i>, pass’d the <i>Hellespont</i>, made the expedition into <i>Colchis</i>,
    and built a like temple there. And a compass box called the golden
    <i>ram</i>, was made alike part of the object of their adoration. This is
    exceedingly confirm’d by the report of <i>Herodotus</i> and <i>Diodorus S.</i>
    who say, the <i>Colchi</i> practised the rite of circumcision, a matter
    which the learned cannot account for; but appears plain from hence:
    these being the descendants of <i>Abraham</i>. They say, at the same time,
    that the <i>Ethiopians</i> practise the like: and that ’tis no recent custom
    among them, but from the beginning. I apprehend by <i>Ethiopians</i> are
    meant <i>Arabians</i>, who are people descended from <i>Abraham</i>. <i>Herodotus</i>
    says likewise the <i>Egyptians</i> circumcis’d, which must be accounted for
    in this same manner; some <i>Arabian</i> or <i>Ethiopian</i> nation bringing
    the custom among them. As a further confirmation of <i>Phrixus</i> being
    <i>Aphricus</i>, <i>Bochart</i> shews the <i>Colchic</i> and <i>Hebrew</i> tongue is much
    a-kin. And thus we may account for what Mr. <i>Toland</i>, p. 133. says,
    that the idiom of the <i>Irish</i> language (which we suppose the remnant of
    the most antient oriental,) has a mixture of <i>Arabic</i> in it.</p>

  <p>I saw a book in Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s library, <i>Museo de las medallas
    desconocidas Espanolas</i>, p. 35. N<sup>o</sup>. 82, 83. are two ancient unknown
    medals, such as they often find in <i>Spain</i>. The first a head (not of
    the best workmanship) on the obverse, young, but heroical enough, a
    necklace on. Behind it Α Φ Ρ Α in the old <i>Phœnician</i> character, like
    the <i>Samaritan</i>. Reverse a horseman, and under the exergue another
    word in like <i>Punic</i> character. The other N<sup>o</sup>. 83. has the same head
    in the obverse, but without the necklace: and Α Φ Ρ Α before, in plain
    <i>Greek</i>, behind a dolphin. The reverse as the last. There is another
    such coin in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> same book, no difference, but the name and dolphin
    transpos’d. I verily believe this is our <i>Aphra</i>, or <i>Apher</i> in our
    <i>English</i> translation call’d <i>Epher</i>, <i>Gen.</i> xxv. 4. struck by some
    city in <i>Spain</i>, who acknowledged him their founder.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable enough, what Mr. <i>Norden</i> writes, in his history of
    <i>Cornwall</i>. The <i>Cornish</i> men universally suppose that the <i>Jews</i>
    are the people who first work’t in their rocks, for tin: and in old
    neglected tin-works, they find some of their tools. The workmen call
    them <i>attal sarazin</i>, the <i>Jews</i> cast off works, in their <i>Hebrew</i>
    speech, says <i>Norden</i>. Now I apprehend he means our <i>Arabians</i>: and it
    is a circumstance confirming the former notions. And to it we may refer
    the origin of the odd reports, of our <i>Stonehenge</i> coming from <i>Africa</i>
    and the like. By the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Hercules Melcartus</i> or <i>Melicerta</i>,
    and <i>Phrixus</i> or <i>Apricus</i> are made half brothers: by <i>Josephus</i>,
    <i>Hercules</i> is son-in-law to <i>Aphricus</i>. The <i>Phœnicians</i> paid tythe. So
    the <i>Arabians</i>, in <i>Pliny</i>, the like: being patriarchal customs.</p>

  <p><i>Aphricus</i> or <i>Phryxus</i> we may very well suppose to be father of the
    <i>Phrygians</i>. And his expedition thro’ the <i>propontis</i> to the <i>Euxine</i>
    sea, the <i>Greeks</i> colour over with their <i>Helle</i> and <i>Hellespont</i>. But
    we cannot entertain too high a respect for him, because I see it no
    less reasonable, to refer the origin of the <i>Britons</i> to him. I mean
    that eastern colony that came hither with <i>Hercules</i>, upon the old
    possessors or <i>aborigines Albionites</i>, which gave the more famous name
    of <i>Britain</i> to the island. The <i>Brigantes</i> is the same name, says Mr.
    <i>Baxter</i> the common and more ancient name of this people: who being
    driven northwards by inundations of foreigners from the continent in
    after times, the name became more appropriate to the inhabitants of
    <i>Yorkshire</i> and the neighbouring counties. In <i>Tacitus</i> the <i>Brigantes</i>
    are called <i>maxima Brittanorum natio</i>. At the same time they forc’d
    the ancientest possessors, the <i>Albionites</i> or <i>Albanians</i> still more
    northwards. Likewise many of these <i>Brigantes</i> pass’d into <i>Ireland</i>,
    where they became a famous nation. The <i>Bryges</i>, <i>Phryges</i>, <i>Phrixi</i>,
    <i>Brisones</i>, <i>Brigantes</i>, <i>Britones</i> are intirely synonimous words in
    different dialects. And this assignment of the origin of our ancestors,
    very well accounts for that notion of their <i>Phrygian</i> or <i>Trojan</i>
    descent, so riveted in the minds of the old <i>Britons</i>. A notion which
    prevail’d among some of the <i>Gallic</i> nations on the continent, and they
    had retain’d the memory of it, in the time of <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>,
    who mentions it. Likewise in <i>Cæsar</i>’s time, some <i>Gallic</i> nations,
    claimed kindred with the <i>Romans</i>; probably upon this very account.</p>

  <p>This is, in short, some presumptive evidence we have, of <i>Hercules</i>
    and <i>Aphricus</i> planting <i>Britain</i>, introducing the Druids with the
    patriarchal religion: and concerning the knowledge they had of the use
    of the compass. This whole matter will be further considered, when I
    come to treat of it expressly. At present we will continue the history
    of the compass, as it became more fully known to the world.</p>

  <p><i>Martinius</i> in his <i>Atlas</i>, and <i>Gilbertus de magnete</i>, <i>Lib.</i> I.
    2. show us, the <i>Chinese</i> have us’d the magnetic needle from times
    immemorial: that they have a trick of telling fortunes with it: as
    the heathen afore-mentioned made it oracular. The <i>Arabians</i> likewise
    have us’d it, for travelling over the great and wild desarts, of
    weeks together, where there is no track to guide them; nor have
    they any notion of time when they began this practice. <i>Herwartius</i>
    published <i>admiranda ethnicæ theologiæ</i>, wherein he endeavours to
    prove that the old <i>Egyptians</i> had the use of the magnetic needle,
    and that the <i>Bembin</i> table contains the doctrine of it, invelop’d
    in hieroglyphicks. The learned <i>Fuller</i> in his <i>Miscellanies Lib.</i>
    4. 19. asserts, that the <i>Phœnicians</i> knew the use of it, which they
    endeavour’d to conceal by all possible means, as they did their trading
    in general. That it was lost with them, as many other arts, their <i>ars
    plumaria</i>, the dying of purple, (the invention of our <i>Hercules</i> of
    <i>Tyre</i>) the <i>Hebrew</i> poetry, and other curious knowledge, which is
    perished.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

  <p>’Tis not unlikely that the lodestone being applied to religious use,
    was one cause of its being forgot: together with the secrecy of the
    <i>Phœnician</i> voyages. <i>Suetonius</i> in <i>Nero</i>, speaks of a prophetic
    needle, which the emperor us’d to pay his devotions to. The learned
    <i>Burman</i> shews, that most, or all of the old MSS. and printed books,
    read it <i>acuncula</i>, <i>acucula</i>, or <i>acungula</i>; which, in my opinion, the
    criticks have causelesly corrected into <i>icuncula</i>: because they had no
    notion of the magnetic needle being understood by it.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Fauchet</i>, a famous <i>French</i> antiquary, in his antiquities of
    <i>France</i>, quotes some verses from a poet in that country, who wrote A. D.
    1180, wherein is as plain a description of the mariner’s box, as
    words can make. The poet mentions it by accident, not as a thing new
    and strange. <i>Osorius</i> in his discourse of the acts of king <i>Emanuel</i>,
    refers the use of the compass among the <i>Europeans</i>, to <i>Gama</i> and
    the <i>Portuguese</i>, who found it among some barbarous pyrates, about
    the <i>Cape</i> of <i>Good Hope</i>; who probably were some remains of the old
    <i>Phœnicians</i>, or <i>Arabians</i>, or at least have preserved from them, this
    practice. About A. D. 1260. <i>Paulus Venetus</i> is said to have brought
    it from <i>China</i>; by the great author on the magnet, our countryman
    <i>Gilbert</i>. <i>Genebrand</i> in his <i>chron.</i> says, the use of the lode-stone
    reviv’d among us about A. D. 1303. by <i>Fl. Melvius</i> a <i>Neapolitan</i>,
    and others attribute it about that time to <i>John Goia</i> a <i>Neapolitan</i>.
    <i>Joseph de Costa</i> says, some <i>Mahometan</i> seamen whom <i>Vasquez de
      Gama</i> met with near <i>Mosambick</i>, who had sail’d those seas by the use
    thereof, taught it him. I observe our ancient <i>Britons</i>, the <i>Welsh</i>,
    call a steers-man or pilot <i>llywydd</i>, whence no doubt comes our
    <i>English</i> word lode-stone, and lode-star, the north-pole. <i>Llyw</i> is the
    helm of a ship in <i>British</i>. <i>Lodemanage</i> in <i>Skinner</i>’s <i>etymology</i> an
    old <i>English</i> word, signifying the price paid to the pilot. Our lords
    of the <i>Cinque Ports</i> keep a court at <i>Dover</i>, by that name. These
    things seem to indicate some memorial of the magnet left among the
    <i>Welsh</i>, from the oldest times: and of its application to sailing.</p>

  <p>Thus have we given a kind of history of this prodigy in nature, the
    magnetic needle: to confirm, our suspicion, that the <i>British</i> Druids
    knew the use of it, and used it in these works of theirs, which we
    have been treating of. We learn in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
    <i>Lowthorp</i>, Vol. II. p. 601. that there are considerable veins of the
    magnet, in our own country, in <i>Devonshire</i>; where the <i>Phœnicians</i> and
    Druids must needs be very conversant.</p>

  <p>We return now to our first subject <i>Stonehenge</i>, and apply what has
    been said, to the observation we there made. It is not to be thought,
    that the Druids, men who employed themselves in those noble studies,
    which <i>Cæsar</i> gives us an account of, and who were at the pains of
    bringing these vast stones together, from such a considerable distance
    of 16 miles: I say, it is not to be thought, but that they would be
    nice and exact in placing them. And this, not only particularly, in
    respect of each other, upon the projected ground-plot: but also in
    general, in respect of the quarters of the heavens. And this I found
    to be a just surmise, when I examined their works for several years
    together, with sufficient accuracy, with a <i>theodilite</i>. As I took
    notice before, the works of one place regarded the cardinal points,
    but with a certain uniform variation therefrom. Whence I grounded my
    conjecture, that they were set by a compass, which at that time varied,
    according to that quantity observ’d. Of which property of variation
    we may well suppose, the Druids were ignorant. This I now propose for
    the rule of investigation, of the time when <i>Stonehenge</i> was erected.
    Hoping the reader will judge as favourably of the attempt, as things of
    this great antiquity require.</p>

  <p>The variation at <i>Stonehenge</i> is about 6 or 7 degrees, from the north
    eastward. I have in order to form our hypothesis, set down a scheme of
    the state of the variation in <i>England</i>, from the best observations
    I could meet with. Dr. <i>Halley</i> takes notice, that the variation at
    <i>Paris</i> is always 2 degrees and a half <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>more easterly than with us.
    <i>Orontius Finæus</i> in 1550 observ’d it to be there, about 9 degrees,
    easterly, therefore to reduce it, I have stated it at 11 degrees 30.
    and from thence continued it, to the present time, as in the ensuing
    table.</p>

  <p>By this table it appears, that in the space of 180 years, the variation
    of the magnetic needle in <i>England</i>, has shifted from 11 degrees and
    a half eastward, to 11 degrees and a half westward. In 90 years the
    medium of those extremes, which was 1657, there was no variation at
    all; the needle pointing due north and south. But alas our observations
    extend no farther. We know not the bound of the variation, on either
    hand: nor the quantity of its motion, when thereabouts. Mr. <i>Geo.
      Graham</i> thinks it is now near the western bound. It is very slow, in
    all probability, when upon the return, and as it were, stationary:
    like the sun’s motion at the tropics, when it is returning. So that
    the nice determination of its circle, and of its motion, is reserved
    for remote posterity. Dr. <i>Halley</i> conjectures, that the whole period
    of variation, is perform’d in about 700 years. Upon this supposition,
    in gross, we may thus found our conjecture, of the time of building of
    <i>Stonehenge</i>.</p>

  <p>By what we can find, the variation is about 9 minutes in a year, or
    a degree and a half in 10 years, at this part of its circle. Now I
    observ’d at <i>Stonehenge</i>, that the eastern wing of the avenue, the
    <i>cursus</i> and other parts belonging to the temple, abated somewhat in
    their variation, eastward, being somewhat less than that of the temple
    itself. It is highly reasonable to believe, that the great work of
    <i>Stonehenge</i> could not take less than half a score years in building:
    and that those other works were made in succeeding years, not long
    after it was finished. From hence I gather, which way the magnetic
    variation was moving, at the time of founding <i>Stonehenge</i>, <i>viz.</i> from
    east toward no variation and so to west. This must be the foundation of
    our <i>calculus</i>.</p>

  <p>Therefore at the time of the founding of <i>Stonehenge</i>, the variation
    was about the same quantity and place, as about A. D. 1620. in our
    preceding table. Supposing with Dr. <i>Halley</i>, the revolution of this
    variation be about 700 years, three intire revolutions thereof, bring
    us to about the year of the city of <i>Rome</i> 280. which is about 460
    years before our Saviour’s time: 420 years before <i>Cæsar</i> invaded
    <i>Britain</i>. About 100 years before our Saviour’s birth, <i>Divitiacus</i>
    made the <i>Wansdike</i> north of <i>Stonehenge</i>, and drove the possessors
    of this fine country of the <i>Wiltshire</i> downs, northwards. So that
    the Druids enjoyed their magnificent work of <i>Stonehenge</i>, but about
    360 years. And the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> great number of barrows about it, requires,
    that we should not much shorten the time. Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i> in his
    <i>Chronology</i>, reckons 19 years for a medium of a king’s reign. So
    that in that space, there were about 19 kings, in this country. And
    there seems to be about that number of royal barrows (in my way of
    conjecturing) about the place.</p>

  <p>I observe, this time we have assign’d for the building of <i>Stonehenge</i>,
    is not long after <i>Cambyses</i>’s invasion of <i>Egypt</i>. When he committed
    such horrid outrages there, and made such dismal havock, with the
    priests and inhabitants in general, that they fled the country to all
    parts of the world. Some went as far as the <i>East Indies</i>, and there
    taught many of the antient <i>Egyptian</i> customs; as is taken notice of
    by the learned. It is not to be doubted that some of them fled as far
    westward, into the island of <i>Britain</i>, and introduced some of their
    learning, arts and religion, among the Druids; and perhaps had a hand
    in this very work of <i>Stonehenge</i>: the only one that I know of, where
    the stones are chizel’d. All other works of theirs, are of rude stones,
    untouch’d of tool, exactly after the patriarchal and <i>Jewish</i> mode:
    therefore older.</p>

  <p>This was at a time, when the <i>Phœnician</i> trade was at height, the
    readier a conveyance to <i>Britain</i>: it was before the second temple at
    <i>Jerusalem</i> was built: before the <i>Grecians</i> had any history.</p>
